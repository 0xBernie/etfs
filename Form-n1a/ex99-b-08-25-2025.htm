    The Shareholders entitled to vote are determined in accordance with the
    Declaration of Trust. Voting may be by voice vote, show of hands, written
    ballot, or any secure electronic system authorized by the Trustees. Unless a
    greater vote is required by the 1940 Act, the Declaration of Trust, these
    By-Laws, or a Board resolution, a majority of votes cast decides any matter.

    cast.<br />

    the outset.<br />

    of votes that would be necessary to authorize the action at a meeting.<br />
    Section 10. Record Date.<br />
    The Trustees may fix in advance a record date, not more than 120 nor fewer
    than 7 calendar days before the meeting or action, to determine Shareholders
    entitled to notice, to vote, or to give consent. Different record dates may
    be set for different Series or Classes.<br />

    A Shareholder may vote in person or by proxy executed in writing or by
    electronic transmission and dated not more than 11 months before the meeting
    unless a longer period is expressly provided. A proxy continues in effect
    until revoked in the manner specified by Delaware law.<br />

    determine the number of Shares outstanding, ascertain the votes, and certify
    the results.<br />

    Except as otherwise required by statute or the Declaration of Trust, the
    holders of one-third of all Shares entitled to vote, present in person or by

    adjourned as provided in Section 6.<br />
    Section 14. Meetings by Remote Communication.<br />

    reasonable opportunity to participate and vote.<br />
    <br />
    ARTICLE V - TRUSTEE MEETINGS<br />
    Section 1. Regular Meetings.<br />
    Regular meetings of the Trustees shall be held, without additional notice,
    at the dates, times and places (which may include remote-only meetings)

    resolution is adopted shall be given prompt notice of the schedule.<br />
    Section 2. Special Meetings.<br />
    Special meetings may be called at any time by the Chair (or any Co-Chair),
    the President, or any two Trustees. Notice stating the time, place (or
    remote platform) and purpose shall be given to each Trustee at least 24
    hours in advance by personal delivery, telephone, electronic mail, or other
    electronic transmission, or three calendar days in advance if delivered by
    overnight courier or U.S. mail.<br />
    Section 3. Quorum.<br />
    The presence in person or by permitted remote means of a majority of the
    Trustees then in office constitutes a quorum for the transaction of
    business, unless a larger percentage is required by the Declaration of Trust
    or the Investment Company Act of 1940.<br />
    Section 4. Place of Meetings; Remote Participation.<br />
    Meetings may be held at the Trust's principal executive office or any other
    place the Trustees designate. Any meeting, regular or special, may be
    conducted wholly or partially by conference call, video conference or other
    means of remote communication that allows all participating Trustees to hear
    each other simultaneously. Participation by such means constitutes presence
    in person.<br />
    Section 5. Notice and Waiver.<br />
    A Trustee may waive any required notice before or after the meeting by
    written waiver, electronic transmission, or by attending the meeting without
    objection at its outset. The business to be transacted need not be specified
    in the notice or waiver, except when required by law.<br />
    Section 6. Adjournment; Notice.<br />
    A majority of Trustees present, whether or not a quorum is present, may
    adjourn any meeting to another time, date or place. If the adjournment is
    for more than 48 hours, notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given to
    all Trustees not present at the time of adjournment; otherwise, further
    notice is waived.<br />
    Section 7. Action Without a Meeting.<br />
    Any action required or permitted to be taken at a meeting may be taken
    without a meeting if a written consent (including electronic or facsimile
    signature) setting forth the action is signed by a majority of the Trustees
    then in office, including at least the minimum number of independent
    Trustees required by the Investment Company Act of 1940, and filed with the
    Trust's minutes. Such consent has the same force as a vote at a duly called
    meeting.<br />
    Section 8. Presence by Remote Communication.<br />
    Trustees participating in a meeting through permitted remote communication
    technology shall be deemed present in person, and the meeting shall be
    deemed held at the Trust's principal executive office unless otherwise
    stated in the minutes.<br />
    Section 9. Unanimous Meeting.<br />
    If all Trustees are present (physically or remotely) when a meeting is
    called to order, any business may be transacted without regard to the notice
    requirements of Section 2, provided that each Trustee either waives notice
    or is deemed to have waived notice under Section 5.<br />
    Section 10. Minutes.<br />
    The Secretary, or in the Secretary's absence an Assistant Secretary or other
    person designated by the presiding officer, shall record the proceedings of
    each Trustee meeting in the Trust's minute books, which shall be maintained
    at the principal executive office or such other location designated by the
    Trustees.<br />
    <br />
    ARTICLE VI - COMMITTEES OF TRUSTEES<br />
    Section 1. Establishment and Powers.<br />
    By resolution adopted by a majority of the Trustees then in office, the
    Trustees may create one or more committees (including an Executive
    Committee) composed solely of Trustees and may delegate to any such
    committee any authority the Trustees may lawfully delegate, subject to the
    Declaration of Trust, Rule 17g-1 and Rule 38a-1 under the 1940 Act, and
    other applicable law. Each committee shall keep minutes of its proceedings,
    report regularly to the Trustees, and serves at the pleasure of the
    Trustees, who may enlarge, limit, or rescind any delegation at any time,
    prospectively.<br />
    Section 2. Proceedings and Quorum.<br />
    Unless the Trustees provide otherwise, a majority of the members of any
    committee constitutes a quorum, and the vote of a majority of the quorum is
    the act of the committee. Members may participate through any means of
    communication that allows all participants to hear each other
    simultaneously, and such participation constitutes presence in person. Each
    committee may adopt additional procedures consistent with these By-Laws and
    Delaware law. Vacancies may be filled, and alternate members appointed, by
    the Trustees at any time.<br />
    Section 3. Compensation.<br />
    Committee members may receive such compensation and reimbursement of
    expenses, if any, as the Trustees determine. Compensation of any committee
    member who is also the Chief Compliance Officer must comply with Rule 38a-1
    under the 1940 Act.<br />
    <br />
    ARTICLE VII - SHARES OF BENEFICIAL INTEREST<br />
    Section 1. Unlimited Shares; Series and Classes.<br />
    The beneficial interest in the Trust is divided into an unlimited number of
    transferable Shares of one or more Series or Classes, all without par value
    and fully paid and non-assessable. Except as the Trustees expressly provide
    for a particular Class, each Share of a Series represents an equal,
    undivided beneficial interest in that Series' net assets.<br />
    Section 2. Transfer of Shares.<br />
    A Share is transferable only upon presentation of proper transfer
    instructions (and any certificate, if certificates have been authorized) to
    the Trust or its duly appointed transfer agent, together with such evidence
    of authority as the Trustees may reasonably require. Until the transfer is
    recorded, the transferor remains the Shareholder of record for all
    purposes.<br />
    Section 3. Equitable Interests Not Recognized.<br />
    The Trust shall treat the registered holder of any Share as the absolute
    owner thereof and shall not be bound to recognize any equitable, beneficial
    or other claim to, or interest in, such Share by any Person other than the
    holder of record, except as otherwise required by law.<br />
    Section 4. Share Certificates; Book-Entry Form.<br />
    Unless the Trustees determine otherwise, Shares shall be uncertificated and
    maintained on the books of the Trust or its transfer agent. In lieu of a
    certificate, the Trust or its agent may issue a written or electronic
    confirmation. Any certificate the Trustees authorize shall state
    conspicuously that liability is limited to Trust or Series assets and shall
    be executed in the form prescribed by the Trustees.<br />
    Section 5. Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates.<br />
    The Trustees may require any Shareholder requesting a replacement
    certificate to furnish an affidavit of loss and to post a bond or other
    security sufficient to indemnify the Trust against any loss or claim arising
    from the issuance of the replacement certificate.<br />
    Section 6. Regulatory Restrictions.<br />
    To protect the Trust's status under the Internal Revenue Code, the 1940 Act,
    or other applicable law, the Trustees may refuse to issue or transfer, or
    may compel the redemption of, Shares if they determine that ownership by any
    Person may result in adverse legal, tax or regulatory consequences to the
    Trust or its Shareholders.<br />
    <br />
    ARTICLE VIII - OWNERSHIP OF ASSETS OF THE TRUST<br />
    The Trustees, acting for and on behalf of the Trust, shall be deemed to hold
    both legal and beneficial title to (i) all portfolio securities and other
    property of the Trust, and (ii) any income, dividends, proceeds or rights
    derived therefrom, whether such assets or issuers are organized under the
    laws of the United States or any foreign jurisdiction. No Shareholder shall
    have, or may assert, any direct ownership interest in any specific asset of
    the Trust.<br />
    <br />
    ARTICLE IX - INSPECTION OF RECORDS<br />
    Section 1. Inspection by Shareholders.<br />
    The Trustees shall determine whether, to what extent, at what times, and
    under what conditions the Trust's books, accounts and records may be
    inspected by Shareholders, consistent with the 1940 Act and Delaware law. No
    Shareholder has an inherent right of inspection except as expressly granted
    by the Trustees or required by law.<br />
    Section 2. Inspection by Trustees.<br />
    Every Trustee has an absolute right at any reasonable time to inspect all
    books, records and documents of every kind and the physical properties of
    the Trust, in person or by agent, and to make copies or extracts.<br />
    Section 3. Financial Statements.<br />
    Semi-annual and annual financial statements prepared for each Series shall
    be kept on file at the principal executive office for at least twelve months
    and made available to any Shareholder upon written request, or mailed in
    accordance with SEC rules.<br />
    <br />
    ARTICLE X - INSURANCE AND INDEMNIFICATION OF TRUSTEES, OFFICERS AND
    EMPLOYEES<br />
    Section 1. Permitted Insurance.<br />
    The Trust may purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any current or
    former Trustee, officer, employee or agent ("Covered Person") against any
    liability asserted against, and incurred by, that Covered Person in such
    capacity, to the fullest extent permitted by the 1940 Act, the Delaware
    Statutory Trust Act and other applicable law.<br />
    Section 2. Prohibited Coverage.<br />
    No policy shall insure any Covered Person against liability to the Trust or
    its Shareholders arising from willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross
    negligence, or reckless disregard of duties involved in the conduct of such
    Covered Person's office ("Disabling Conduct").<br />
    Section 3. Indemnification.<br />
    To the maximum extent permitted by Article IX of the Declaration of Trust,
    the Trust shall indemnify and hold harmless each Covered Person against all
    losses, claims, damages or expenses reasonably incurred, except to the
    extent resulting from that person's Disabling Conduct. The Trustees may
    enter into separate indemnification agreements consistent with this
    Section.<br />
    Section 4. Advancement of Expenses.<br />
    The Trust shall advance reasonable expenses of defense to any Covered Person
    entitled to indemnification upon receipt of an undertaking to repay such
    amounts if ultimately found not entitled to indemnification.<br />
    <br />
    ARTICLE XI - SEAL<br />
    Section 1. Adoption and Use.<br />
    The Trustees may adopt a seal of the Trust in such form and with such
    inscription as they determine. Unless the Trustees require otherwise, the
    seal need not be affixed to, and its absence shall not affect the validity
    of, any document executed on behalf of the Trust.<br />
    Section 2. Authority to Affix.<br />
    Any Trustee, officer or authorized agent may affix the seal to any
    instrument executed in the name of the Trust.<br />
    <br />
    ARTICLE XII - FISCAL YEAR<br />
    The fiscal year of the Trust and of each Series or Class shall be fixed, and
    may be changed, by resolution of the Trustees or by such officer as the
    Trustees delegate.<br />
    <br />
    ARTICLE XIII - AMENDMENTS<br />
    Except as otherwise required by the Declaration of Trust or applicable law,
    these By-Laws may be amended, restated, supplemented or repealed only by
    majority vote of the Trustees then in office; Shareholder approval is not
    required. No amendment may limit retroactively the rights to indemnification
    or insurance provided in the Declaration of Trust or these By-Laws with
    respect to acts or omissions occurring prior to the amendment.<br />
    <br />
    ARTICLE XIV - NOTICES<br />
    Section 1. Form and Delivery.<br />
    Notices to Shareholders or Trustees may be given personally, by mail,
    courier, overnight delivery, telephone, electronic mail, facsimile, or any
    other means permitted by Delaware law. Mailed notice is deemed given when
    deposited with postage prepaid; electronic notice when transmitted to the
    address supplied to the Trust. Electronic transmissions that satisfy the
    Delaware Uniform Electronic Transactions Act (or any successor statute) are
    deemed written notices for all purposes of these By-Laws and the Declaration
    of Trust.<br />
    Section 2. Waiver of Notice.<br />
    A Shareholder or Trustee may waive any notice before or after the date and
    time stated in it by a written or electronic waiver filed with the Trust's
    records. Attendance at a meeting, without timely objection, constitutes a
    waiver of notice.<br />
    <br />
    ARTICLE XV - HEADINGS<br />
    Section headings appear solely for organizational ease and have no bearing
    on the construction or effect of these By-Laws.<br />
    <br />
    ARTICLE XVI - GENERAL PROVISIONS<br />
    Section 1. Checks, Drafts and Other Instruments.<br />
    All checks, drafts, payment orders, notes and other evidences of
    indebtedness issued in the name of the Trust or any Series shall be signed
    or endorsed by the Treasurer or such other officer, agent or depository as
    the Trustees may authorize by resolution.<br />
    Section 2. Contracts and Commitments.<br />
    Except as the Trustees may otherwise direct, the President, any Vice
    President, the Treasurer or any person authorized by them may enter into any
    contract or execute any instrument in the name of and on behalf of the Trust
    or any Series, and such authority may be general or confined to specific
    instances. No person shall bind the Trust except as authorized in this
    Section or by Board resolution.<br />
    Section 3. Electronic Writings and Signatures.<br />
    To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, (a) any requirement in
    these By-Laws that a document be "written" or "in writing" is satisfied by
    an electronic record in a form acceptable to the Trustees, and (b) an
    "electronic signature" in a form acceptable to the Trustees satisfies any
    requirement that a writing be "signed."<br />
    Section 4. Severability.<br />
    If any provision of these By-Laws is held invalid or unenforceable in any
    jurisdiction, that outcome will not impair the remainder of the document,
    nor affect the validity of that provision in other jurisdictions. Should the
    Trustees, after consulting counsel, conclude that a provision conflicts with
    applicable law, that clause will be treated as if it never formed part of
    these By-Laws, without invalidating prior actions duly taken.<br />
    <br />
    END OF BY-LAWS<br />
    Approved by the Board of Trustees of the Trust on July 15, 2025, effective
    July 15, 2025.<br />
