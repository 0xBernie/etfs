    <h1>CORGI ETF TRUST I</h1>
    <h2>JOINT CODE OF ETHICS</h2>
    <br />
    Corgi ETF Trust I (the "Trust") &amp; Corgi Strategies, LLC (the
    "Adviser")<br />
    Adopted pursuant to Rule 17j-1 under the Investment Company Act of 1940 and
    Rule 204A-1 under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 to deter and detect
    unlawful or unethical conduct by Access Persons.<br />
    <br />
    I. INTRODUCTION<br />
    The Board of Trustees (the "Board") of the Trust and the executive
    management of the Adviser have determined that this Code is reasonably
    designed to prevent conduct proscribed by Rule 17j-1 and Rule 204A-1 and to
    promote fiduciary principles.<br />
    Capitalised terms not defined in-line are set forth in Annex A
    (Glossary).<br />
    A. Structure.<br />
    The Trust is a Delaware statutory trust registered as an open-end investment
    company. Each series, currently Founder-Led ETF (FDRS), Founder-Led 2x Daily
    ETF (FDRX) and any future series (collectively, the "Funds"), is advised by
    the Adviser.<br />
    B. Covered Persons.<br />
    This Code applies to every officer, director, employee, consultant or other
    "supervised person" of the Adviser or the Trust (collectively, "Access
    Persons") as that term is defined in Rule 17j-1.<br />
    1. Any natural person who, in the ordinary course of duties, participates in
    or obtains information regarding Fund securities transactions.<br />
    2. Any person with access to non-public portfolio information.<br />
    3. Any trustee, officer or director of the Distributor whose functions
    relate to Fund trades.<br />
    <br />
    II. FIDUCIARY STANDARDS AND BUSINESS CONDUCT<br />
    Put the interests of Fund shareholders and other advisory clients ahead of
    personal gain.<br />
    Execute personal transactions only in a manner that avoids actual or
    apparent conflicts with client trading.<br />
    Never use one's position or information gained through that position for
    inappropriate personal advantage.<br />
    All Access Persons must at all times comply with Section 206 of the Advisers
    Act and with applicable federal securities laws.<br />
    <br />
    III. PERSONAL SECURITIES TRANSACTIONS<br />
    (A) No Access Person shall, directly or indirectly, employ any device,
    scheme or artifice to defraud a Fund; make any statement that is materially
    false or misleading, or omit material facts necessary for the statement to
    be accurate; engage in any act, practice or course of business that operates
    as a fraud; or manipulate the price or market for any security held or to be
    acquired for a Fund.<br />
    (B) Prior written approval from the Chief Compliance Officer ("CCO") is
    required before any Access Person acquires beneficial ownership of (i)
    securities issued in an initial public offering or (ii) securities offered
    in a transaction exempt from registration under Sections 4(a)(2) or 4(a)(5)
    of the Securities Act, or Rules 504-506 thereunder. Approval, if granted, is
    valid only for the calendar day on which it is issued.<br />
    (C) Routine Pre-clearance. Except for "Exempt Securities" (Annex F), no
    Access Person may buy or sell a security in which he or she has a beneficial
    interest unless the trade is pre-cleared by the CCO. Requests are made via
    the Personal Trade Request Form (Annex B). Approval may be revoked prior to
    execution. Requests submitted by the Chief Compliance Officer ("CCO") must
    be reviewed and approved by the Chief Legal Officer or, if none, an
    Independent Trustee designated by the Board. Pre-clearance normally will be
    denied if the same security is (i) held by any Fund on that day, (ii) being
    considered for purchase or sale by any Fund, or (iii) subject to a pending
    allocation notice.<br />
    (D) 30-Day Rule. An Access Person may not profit from the purchase and sale,
    or sale and purchase, of the same (or equivalent) security within 30
    calendar days. Any profit will be donated to a charity chosen by the
    Adviser, and the transaction history will be reported to the Board at its
    next regular meeting.<br />
    (E) Short sales, short calls, or purchases of puts against any security,
    including inverse ETFs, require CCO approval and are strictly prohibited
    when the position targets a Fund or any pooled vehicle advised by the
    Adviser.<br />
    (F) Independent Trustees. Independent Trustees who have no day-to-day access
    to confidential portfolio information are exempt from paragraphs C-F above,
    except where they knowingly trade on non-public information received in
    their trustee capacity.<br />
    <br />
    IV. REPORTING AND DISCLOSURE OBLIGATIONS<br />
    1. Within 10 days of becoming an Access Person—and each January
    thereafter—submit an Initial/Annual Holdings Report current to within 45
    days.<br />
    2. No later than 30 days after each calendar quarter end, file a Quarterly
    Transaction Report covering all reportable securities and any new brokerage
    accounts.<br />
    3. Direct all brokers to send duplicate trade confirmations and monthly
    statements electronically to the CCO.<br />
    4. The CCO may waive reporting for accounts over which the Access Person has
    no direct or indirect influence or control after obtaining written
    certifications from both the Access Person and the account fiduciary.<br />
    5. Independent Trustees file only when they know or reasonably should know
    that a trade occurred before the next public portfolio posting and involves
    a security currently being bought or sold by a Fund.<br />
    <br />
    V. ADMINISTRATION<br />
    Distribute the Code to all Access Persons and obtain annual
    acknowledgments.<br />
    Maintain an updated roster of Access Persons and their reporting status.<br />
    Each quarter, reconcile reported personal trades to Fund trades and
    investigate variances.<br />
    Report apparent violations to the Board.<br />
    The Board, including a majority of the Independent Trustees, must (i)
    approve this Code before the Trust retains the Adviser and (ii) approve any
    material amendment not later than six months after its adoption.<br />
    Annually, the Adviser will furnish the Board with a written report
    describing Code issues, material violations, sanctions imposed, and
    certifying that procedures remain reasonably designed to prevent
    violations.<br />
    <br />
    VI. RECORDKEEPING<br />
    The Adviser will maintain all records required by Rule 17j-1(d) and Rule
    204-2, including: a copy of the current and past five years' Codes; records
    of violations and sanctions; Access-Person reports; lists of persons subject
    to the Code; annual CCO reports; and approvals for IPOs/Private
    Placements.<br />
    <br />
    VII. MISCELLANEOUS<br />
    A. Confidentiality. All reports and information furnished under this Code
    will be treated as confidential and used solely for compliance purposes,
    except as otherwise required by law or regulation.<br />
    B. Interpretive Standard. The phrase "should have known" does not impose a
    duty of inquiry or impute knowledge based on public Fund disclosures.
    <br />

    Effective: August 22, 2025
