when it buys and sells securities (or “turns over” its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover rate may indicate higher transaction

(or indexing) investment approach designed to track the performance, before fees and expenses, of the Solactive Airlines Index (the “Index”).
The Index is based on a proprietary methodology developed and maintained by Solactive AG (the “Index Provider”), which is
an organization that is independent of, and unaffiliated with, the Fund and Themes Management Company, LLC, the Fund’s investment
adviser (the “Adviser”).</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">In constructing or adjusting the Index, the Index
Provider identifies an “Index Universe” of companies that, on Selection Days (as defined below), fulfill the following requirements:
1) are a part/component of the Solactive Global Benchmark Series (“GBS”) index universe of the Solactive GBS Developed Markets
All Cap USD Index (an index developed and maintained by the Index Provider that intends to track the performance of the all cap covering
approximately the largest 100% of the free-float market capitalization in Developed Markets (as identified by the Index Provider): Australia,
Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway,
Poland, Portugal, Singapore, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and the United States), and 2) are classified in the Airlines
industry by FactSet, which includes companies that provide air transportation of passengers, both scheduled (regular routes) and non-scheduled
(no regular routes). Only one share class of each company is eligible for inclusion in the Index Universe. The eligible share class is
the share class with the higher minimum Average Daily Value Traded over 1 month and over 6 months prior to and including the Selection
Day.</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">Based on the Index Universe, the initial composition
of the Index, as well as any selection for an ordinary rebalance, is determined on the Selection Day by ranking all eligible securities
based on their free float market capitalization in a descending order and selecting the top 30 securities for inclusion in the Index.
The determination of the Index Universe and the selection of securities for inclusion in the Index (“Index Components”) is
made by the Index Provider based on its proprietary methodology. “Selection Day” is 20 business days before the Rebalance
Day. “Rebalance Day” is the first Wednesday in February, May, August and November.</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0 0 0 2.15pt; text-align: justify">On each Selection Day, each Index Component
is assigned a weight according to free float market capitalization. Then, a weight cap is applied for each Index Component by re-distributing
any weight which is larger than 4.5% to the other Index Component proportionally in an iterative manner. Adjustments to the Index are
made on Rebalance Day. The Index Components may change over time.</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">The Fund will invest, under normal circumstances,
at least 80% of its net assets, plus the amount of any borrowings for investment purposes, in securities that comprise the Index and in
American Depositary Receipts (“ADRs”) and Global Depositary Receipts (“GDRs”) based on the securities in the Index
(the “80% Policy”). The Index may include securities of large-, mid- and small-capitalization companies. The Fund's 80% Policy
is non-fundamental and requires 60 days prior written notice to shareholders before it can be changed.</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">The Fund uses a “passive” or indexing
approach to try to achieve the Fund’s investment objective. Unlike many investment companies, the Fund does not try to beat the
Index and does not seek temporary defensive positions when markets decline or appear overvalued. Indexing may eliminate the chance that
the Fund will substantially outperform the Index but also may reduce some of the risks of active management, such as poor security selection.
Indexing seeks to achieve lower costs and better after-tax performance by aiming to keep portfolio turnover low in comparison to actively
managed investment companies.</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">The Fund will generally use a “replication”
strategy to achieve its investment objective, meaning it will invest in all of the component securities of the Index in the same approximate
proportion as in the Index. However, the Fund may utilize a representative sampling strategy with respect to the Index when a replication
strategy might be detrimental or disadvantageous to shareholders, such as when there are practical difficulties or substantial costs involved
in compiling a portfolio of equity securities to replicate the Index, in instances in which a security in the Index becomes temporarily
illiquid, unavailable or less liquid, or as a result of legal restrictions or limitations (such as tax diversification requirements or
sanctions imposed by the U.S. government) that apply to the Fund but not the Index. The Adviser expects that, over time, the correlation
between the Fund’s performance and that of the Index, before fees and expenses, will be 95% or better. If the Fund uses a replication
strategy, it can be expected to have greater correlation to the Index than if it uses a representative sampling strategy.</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">The Fund is considered to be non-diversified, which
means that it may invest more of its assets in the securities of a single issuer or a smaller number of issuers than if it were a diversified
fund. To the extent the Index is concentrated (i.e., holds 25% or more of its total assets) in a particular industry or group of industries,
the Fund is expected to be concentrated in that industry or group of industries to approximately the same extent that the Index concentrates
in an industry or group of industries. [As of May __, 2023, a significant portion of the Index is represented by securities of companies
in the airlines industry and the consumer discretionary and transportation sectors.] The degree to which components of the Index represent
certain sectors or industries may&nbsp;change over time.&#8195;</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0 0 0 0.5in; text-align: justify">Beginning in the first quarter of 2020,
financial markets in the United States and around the world experienced extreme and in many cases unprecedented volatility and severe
losses due to the global pandemic caused by COVID-19, a novel coronavirus. The pandemic has resulted in a wide range of social and economic
disruptions, including closed borders and reduced or prohibited domestic or international travel. Some sectors of the economy and individual
issuers, including Airline Companies, have experienced particularly large losses. Such disruptions may continue for an extended period
of time or reoccur in the future to a similar or greater extent.</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0 0 0 0.5in; text-align: justify">In addition, the Russian invasion of Ukraine
and the resulting sanctions by Western countries on Russia, as well as retaliatory measures by Russia, may have a significant impact on
Airline Companies. Bans on oil and energy imports from Russia by certain Western countries may increase the costs of jet fuel. In addition,
certain Western nations have closed their airspace to all Russian aircraft, issued a recall of leased Russian aircraft and/or seized aircraft
on leased aircraft located in Western airports. In response, Russia has closed its airspace to certain Western aircraft and Russia has
seized certain leased aircraft located in Russia. These actions may lead to higher ticket prices, flight cancellations, longer routes,
fewer diversion airports, a decreased demand for travel, and the permanent loss of property for Western companies. These and any related
events could significantly and adversely affect the Fund’s performance and the value of an investment in the Fund.</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">In constructing or adjusting the Index, the Index
Provider identifies an “Index Universe” of companies that, on Selection Days (as defined below), fulfill the following requirements:
1) are a part/component of the Solactive Global Benchmark Series (“GBS”) index universe of the Solactive GBS China All Cap
USD Index (an index developed and maintained by the Index Provider that intends to track the performance of the all cap covering approximately
the largest 100% of the free-float market capitalization in the Chinese market), and 2) are headquartered or incorporated in China. Based
on the Index Universe, the initial composition of the Index as well as any selection for an ordinary rebalance is determined on the Selection
Day in accordance with the following rules: Companies must fit in the Technology, Healthcare Innovation, Blockchain, Cloud Computing,
Cyber Security, Future Cars, Genomics, Robotics &amp; Automation, Social Media, or Digital Entertainment index categories based on their
FactSet or FactSet Revere Business Industry Classification System (“RBICS”) Classification. All eligible securities are ranked
based on their free float market capitalization in a descending order and the top 100 securities by free float market capitalization are
selected for inclusion in the Index (an “Index Component”). The determination of the Index Universe and the selection of Index
Components is made by the Index Provider based on its proprietary methodology. “Selection Day” is 20 business days before
the Rebalance Day. “Rebalance Day” is the first Wednesday in February, May, August and November.</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">On each Selection Day, each Index Component is assigned
a weight according to free float market capitalization. The weight of individual securities is capped at 10%. Any excess weight is redistributed
to the other Index Components that have a weight of less than 10%. This allocation is performed pro-rata based on the free float market
capitalization. This is an iterative process until the maximum individual of all Index Components is 10%. Adjustments to the Index are
made on Rebalance Day.</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">The Fund will generally use a “replication”
strategy to achieve its investment objective, meaning it will invest in all of the component securities of the Index in the same approximate
proportion as in the Index. However, the Fund may utilize a representative sampling strategy with respect to the Index when a replication
strategy might be detrimental or disadvantageous to shareholders, such as when there are practical difficulties or substantial costs involved
in compiling a portfolio of equity securities to replicate the Index, in instances in which a security in the Index becomes temporarily
illiquid, unavailable or less liquid, or as a result of legal restrictions or limitations (such as tax diversification requirements or
sanctions imposed by the U.S. government) that apply to the Fund but not the Index. The Adviser expects that, over time, the correlation
between the Fund’s performance and that of the Index, before fees and expenses, will be 95% or better. If the Fund uses a replication
strategy, it can be expected to have greater correlation to the Index than if it uses a representative sampling strategy.</p>

the Fund is expected to be concentrated in that industry or group of industries to approximately the same extent that the Index concentrates
in an industry or group of industries. [As of May __, 2023, issuers in the internet industry and communications and information technology
sectors represented a significant portion of the Index.] The degree to which components of the Index represent certain sectors or industries

can be significantly affected by economic and political conditions in China and surrounding Asian countries and may demonstrate significantly
higher volatility from time to time in comparison to developed markets. China may be subject to considerable degrees of economic, political
and social instability. Over the last few decades, the Chinese government has undertaken reform of economic and market practices and has
expanded the sphere of private ownership of property in China. However, Chinese markets generally continue to experience inefficiency,
volatility and pricing anomalies resulting from governmental influence, a lack of publicly available information and/or political and
social instability. Chinese companies are also subject to the risk that Chinese authorities can intervene in their operations and structure.
In addition, the Chinese economy is export-driven and highly reliant on trading with key partners. A downturn in the economies of China’s
primary trading partners could slow or eliminate the growth of the Chinese economy and adversely impact the Fund’s investments.
The Chinese government strictly regulates the payment of foreign currency denominated obligations and sets monetary policy. The Chinese
government may introduce new laws and regulations that could have an adverse effect on the Fund. Although China has begun the process
of privatizing certain sectors of its economy, privatized entities may lose money and/or be re-nationalized.</td></tr></tbody></table>

exchanges outside of China, including on U.S. exchanges, many Chinese-based operating companies are structured as Variable Interest Entities
(“VIEs”). In this structure, the Chinese-based operating company is the VIE and establishes an entity, which is typically
offshore in a foreign jurisdiction, such as the Cayman Islands. The offshore entity lists on a foreign exchange and enters into contractual
arrangements with the VIE. This structure allows Chinese companies in which the government restricts foreign ownership to raise capital
from foreign investors. While the offshore entity has no equity ownership of the VIE, these contractual arrangements permit the offshore
entity to consolidate the VIE’s financial statements with its own for accounting purposes and provide for economic exposure to the
performance of the underlying Chinese operating company. Therefore, an investor in the listed offshore entity, such as the Fund, will
have exposure to the Chinese-based operating company only through contractual arrangements and has no ownership in the Chinese-based operating
company. Furthermore, because the offshore entity only has specific rights provided for in these service agreements with the VIE, its
abilities to control the activities at the Chinese-based operating company are limited and the operating company may engage in activities
that negatively impact investment value.</td></tr></tbody></table>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0 0 0 13.7pt; text-align: justify">While the VIE structure has been widely
adopted, it is not formally recognized under Chinese law and therefore there is a risk that the Chinese government could prohibit the
existence of such structures or negatively impact the VIE’s contractual arrangements with the listed offshore entity by making them
invalid. If these contracts were found to be unenforceable under Chinese law, investors in the listed offshore entity, such as the Fund,
may suffer significant losses with little or no recourse available. If the Chinese government determines that the agreements establishing
the VIE structures do not comply with Chinese law and regulations, including those related to restrictions on foreign ownership, it could
subject a Chinese-based issuer to penalties, revocation of business and operating licenses, or forfeiture of ownership interest.</p>

may cause the Fund to suffer significant losses and difficulties in meeting redemptions. Liquidity risk may be the result of, among other

disasters, new legislation or regulatory changes inside or outside the U.S. Liquid investments may become less liquid after being purchased
by the Fund, particularly during periods of market stress. In addition, if a number of securities held by the Fund stop trading, it may
have a cascading effect and cause the Fund to halt trading. Volatility in market prices will increase the risk of the Fund being subject
to a trading halt. Certain countries in which the Fund may invest may be subject to extended settlement delays and/or foreign holidays,
during which the Fund will unlikely be able to convert holdings to cash.</td></tr></tbody></table>

when it buys and sells securities (or “turns over” its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover rate may indicate higher transaction
costs and may result in higher taxes when Fund Shares are held in a taxable account. These costs, which are not reflected in annual fund
operating expenses or in the example, affect the Fund’s performance. Because the Fund is newly organized, portfolio turnover information
is not yet available.</p>

(or indexing) investment approach designed to track the performance, before fees and expenses, of the Solactive Cloud Computing Index,
or any successor thereto (the “Index”). The Index is based on a proprietary methodology developed and maintained by Solactive
AG (the “Index Provider”), which is an organization that is independent of, and unaffiliated with, the Fund and Themes Management

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">Based on the Index Universe, all securities are ranked
based on their free float market capitalization in a descending order and the top ranked securities within the Index Categories are included
as eligible securities as follows: 10 companies from digital security software, 3 companies from e-commerce infrastructure software, 10
companies from data infrastructure software, 10 companies from data architecture software, 20 companies from internet infrastructure software
and 20 companies from data support software. The top 50 securities are selected for the Index. In case there are less than 50 eligible
securities, all eligible securities are selected and the Index will consist of less than 50 securities. The components of the Index (each,
an “Index Component”) may change over time. The determination of the Index Universe and the selection of Index Components
is made by the Index Provider based on its proprietary methodology. Selection Day is 20 business days before the Rebalance Day. The Index
is adjusted on the Rebalance Day which is the first Wednesday in February, May, August, and November. If that day is not a trading day
the Rebalance Day will be the next trading day.</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">On each Selection Day, each Index Component is assigned
an initial weight according to its free float market capitalization. Afterwards, the weights are adjusted by applying a weight cap for
each Index Component by re-distributing any weight which is larger than 4.5% to the other Index Components with an initial weight lower
than 4.5% proportionally in an iterative manner. The weighting process seeks to weight Index Components primarily based on market capitalization,
but subject to caps on the weights of the individual securities. This process is designed to limit the amount of concentration in the
largest market capitalization companies and increase company-level diversification.</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">The Fund will invest, under normal circumstances,
at least 80% of its net assets, plus the amount of any borrowings for investment purposes, in securities that comprise the Index and in
American Depositary Receipts (“ADRs”) and Global Depositary Receipts (“GDRs”) based on the securities in the Index
(the “80% Policy”). Such securities may include those of large-, mid- and small-capitalization companies. The Fund's 80% Policy
is non-fundamental and requires 60 days prior written notice to shareholders before it can be changed.</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">The Fund uses a “passive” or indexing
approach to try to achieve the Fund’s investment objective. Unlike many investment companies, the Fund does not try to beat the
Index and does not seek temporary defensive positions when markets decline or appear overvalued. Indexing may eliminate the chance that
the Fund will substantially outperform the Index but also may reduce some of the risks of active management, such as poor security selection.
Indexing seeks to achieve lower costs and better after-tax performance by aiming to keep portfolio turnover low in comparison to actively
managed investment companies.</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">The Fund will generally use a “replication”
strategy to achieve its investment objective, meaning it will invest in all of the component securities of the Index in the same approximate
proportion as in the Index. However, the Fund may utilize a representative sampling strategy with respect to the Index when a replication
strategy might be detrimental or disadvantageous to shareholders, such as when there are practical difficulties or substantial costs involved
in compiling a portfolio of equity securities to replicate the Index, in instances in which a security in the Index becomes temporarily
illiquid, unavailable or less liquid, or as a result of legal restrictions or limitations (such as tax diversification requirements or
sanctions imposed by the U.S. government) that apply to the Fund but not the Index. The Adviser expects that, over time, the correlation
between the Fund’s performance and that of the Index, before fees and expenses, will be 95% or better. If the Fund uses a replication
strategy, it can be expected to have greater correlation to the Index than if it uses a representative sampling strategy.</p>

the Fund is expected to be concentrated in that industry or group of industries to approximately the same extent that the Index concentrates

may cause the Fund to suffer significant losses and difficulties in meeting redemptions. Liquidity risk may be the result of, among other
things, market turmoil, the reduced number and capacity of traditional market participants, or the lack of an active trading market. Markets
for securities or financial instruments could be disrupted by a number of events, including, but not limited to, an economic crisis, natural
disasters, new legislation or regulatory changes inside or outside the U.S. Liquid investments may become less liquid after being purchased
by the Fund, particularly during periods of market stress. In addition, if a number of securities held by the Fund stop trading, it may
have a cascading effect and cause the Fund to halt trading. Volatility in market prices will increase the risk of the Fund being subject
to a trading halt. Certain countries in which the Fund may invest may be subject to extended settlement delays and/or foreign holidays,
during which the Fund will unlikely be able to convert holdings to cash.</td></tr></tbody></table>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">The Fund pays transaction costs, such as commissions,
when it buys and sells securities (or “turns over” its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover rate may indicate higher transaction
costs and may result in higher taxes when Fund Shares are held in a taxable account. These costs, which are not reflected in annual fund
operating expenses or in the example, affect the Fund’s performance. Because the Fund is newly organized, portfolio turnover information
is not yet available.</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">The Fund employs a “passive management”
(or indexing) investment approach designed to track the performance, before fees and expenses, of Solactive Cyber Security Index, or any
successor thereto (the “Index”). The Index is based on a proprietary methodology developed and maintained by Solactive AG
(the “Index Provider”), which is an organization that is independent of, and unaffiliated with, the Fund and Themes Management

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">The Index is designed to provide exposure to companies
that have business operations in the cybersecurity industry. The Index is denominated in US dollars. [As of May __, 2023, the Index was

market capitalization of $__ billion.]</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">In constructing or adjusting the Index, the Index
Provider identifies an “Index Universe” of companies that, on Selection Days (as defined below), fulfill the following requirements:
1) are a part/component of the Solactive Global Benchmark Series (“GBS”) index universe of the Solactive GBS Global Markets
Digital Infrastructure All Cap USD Index (an index developed and maintained by the Index Provider that intends to track the performance
of all cap securities that have business operations in industries related to digital security software covering approximately the largest

Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Portugal,
Singapore, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and the United States), and 2) only one share class of each company is eligible
for inclusion in the Index Universe. The share class currently included in the Index will be eligible for the Index Universe if its minimum
Average Daily Value Traded over the preceding 1-month and 6-month prior to and including the Selection Day is at least 60% of the minimum

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">Based on the Index Universe, all eligible securities
are ranked based on their free float market capitalization in a descending order. The top 35 ranked securities from the digital security
hardware category are included in the Index. The components of the Index (each, an “Index Component”) may change over time.
The determination of the Index Universe and the selection of Index Components is made by the Index Provider based on its proprietary methodology.
Selection Day is 20 business days before the Rebalance Day. The Index is adjusted on the Rebalance Day which is the first Wednesday in
February, May, August, and November. If that day is not a trading day the Rebalance Day will be the next trading day.</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">On each Selection Day, each Index Component is assigned
an initial weight according to its free float market capitalization. Afterwards, the weights are adjusted by applying a weight cap for
each Index Component by re-distributing any weight which is larger than 4.5% to the other Index Components with an initial weight lower
than 4.5% proportionally in an iterative manner. The weighting process seeks to weight Index Components primarily based on market capitalization,
but subject to caps on the weights of the individual securities. This process is designed to limit the amount of concentration in the
largest market capitalization companies and increase company-level diversification.</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">The Fund will invest, under normal circumstances,
at least 80% of its net assets, plus the amount of any borrowings for investment purposes, in securities that comprise the Index and in
American Depositary Receipts (“ADRs”) and Global Depositary Receipts (“GDRs”) based on the securities in the Index
(the “80% Policy”). The Fund's 80% Policy is non-fundamental and requires 60 days prior written notice to shareholders before
it can be changed.</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">The Fund uses a “passive” or indexing
approach to try to achieve the Fund’s investment objective. Unlike many investment companies, the Fund does not try to beat the
Index and does not seek temporary defensive positions when markets decline or appear overvalued. Indexing may eliminate the chance that
the Fund will substantially outperform the Index but also may reduce some of the risks of active management, such as poor security selection.
Indexing seeks to achieve lower costs and better after-tax performance by aiming to keep portfolio turnover low in comparison to actively
managed investment companies.</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">The Fund will generally use a “replication”
strategy to achieve its investment objective, meaning it will invest in all of the component securities of the Index in the same approximate
proportion as in the Index. However, the Fund may utilize a representative sampling strategy with respect to the Index when a replication
strategy might be detrimental or disadvantageous to shareholders, such as when there are practical difficulties or substantial costs involved
in compiling a portfolio of equity securities to replicate the Index, in instances in which a security in the Index becomes temporarily
illiquid, unavailable or less liquid, or as a result of legal restrictions or limitations (such as tax diversification requirements or
sanctions imposed by the U.S. government) that apply to the Fund but not the Index. The Adviser expects that, over time, the correlation
between the Fund’s performance and that of the Index, before fees and expenses, will be 95% or better. If the Fund uses a replication
strategy, it can be expected to have greater correlation to the Index than if it uses a representative sampling strategy.</p>

These companies are also heavily dependent on intellectual property rights and may be adversely affected by loss or impairment of those

The customers and/or suppliers of Cybersecurity companies may be concentrated in a particular country, region or industry. Any adverse
event affecting one of these countries, regions or industries could have a negative impact on Cybersecurity companies. Confronting cyberthreats
amid increasing remote work environments could result in challenges for Cybersecurity companies.</td></tr></tbody></table>

rates, deficits, interest rates, debt levels and fiscal and monetary controls, each of which may significantly affect every country in
Europe, including those countries that are not members of the EU. Decreasing imports or exports, changes in governmental or EU regulations
on trade, changes in the exchange rate of the euro, the default or threat of default by an EU member country on its sovereign debt, and
recessions in an EU member country may have a significant adverse effect on the economies of EU member countries and their trading partners.
The European financial markets have historically experienced volatility and adverse trends due to concerns about economic downturns or
rising government debt levels in several European countries, including, but not limited to, Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, France, Greece,
Ireland, Italy, Portugal, Spain and Ukraine. These events have adversely affected the exchange rate of the euro and may continue to significantly

of the Fund may only be purchased and sold in the secondary market through brokers at market prices, rather than NAV. Because Shares trade
at market prices rather than NAV, Shares may trade at a price greater than NAV (premium) or less than NAV (discount).</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">The Index is designed to provide exposure to European

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">Based on the Index Universe, the initial composition
of the Index, as well as any selection for an ordinary rebalance, is determined on the Selection Day by first screening publicly available
information such as financial news, business profiles and company publications using the Index Provider’s proprietary natural language
processing algorithm (“ARTIS<sup>®</sup>”) to identify companies that have or are expected to have exposure to the provision
of products and/or services that contribute to the luxury industry. Companies are only eligible if they generate at least 50% of their
revenues from luxury related business operations. This may include companies involved in luxury accessories, premium clothing, luxury
beauty, cars and yachts, and upscale hospitality. Each company identified by ARTIS<sup>® </sup>receives a score that reflects its
exposure to the Index strategy. <font style="font-size: 11pt">This set of companies is then reviewed by the Index Provider and companies
are removed from the selection process if they don’t </font>have business operations consistent with the Index’s luxury theme.
The remaining <font style="font-size: 11pt">companies are ranked by their score (in descending order)</font> and the top 25 companies
are selected for inclusion in the Index (“Index Components”). The determination of the Index Universe and the selection of
Index Components is made by the Index Provider based on its proprietary methodology.</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">The Fund will invest, under normal circumstances,
at least 80% of its net assets, plus the amount of any borrowings for investment purposes, in securities that comprise the Index and in
American Depositary Receipts (“ADRs”) and Global Depositary Receipts (“GDRs”) based on the securities in the Index
(the “80% Policy”). The Index may include securities of large-, mid- and small-capitalization companies. The Fund's 80% Policy
is non-fundamental and requires 60 days prior written notice to shareholders before it can be changed.</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">The Fund uses a “passive” or indexing
approach to try to achieve the Fund’s investment objective. Unlike many investment companies, the Fund does not try to beat the
Index and does not seek temporary defensive positions when markets decline or appear overvalued. Indexing may eliminate the chance that
the Fund will substantially outperform the Index but also may reduce some of the risks of active management, such as poor security selection.
Indexing seeks to achieve lower costs and better after-tax performance by aiming to keep portfolio turnover low in comparison to actively
managed investment companies.</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">The Fund will generally use a “replication”
strategy to achieve its investment objective, meaning it will invest in all of the component securities of the Index in the same approximate
proportion as in the Index. However, the Fund may utilize a representative sampling strategy with respect to the Index when a replication
strategy might be detrimental or disadvantageous to shareholders, such as when there are practical difficulties or substantial costs involved
in compiling a portfolio of equity securities to replicate the Index, in instances in which a security in the Index becomes temporarily
illiquid, unavailable or less liquid, or as a result of legal restrictions or limitations (such as tax diversification requirements) that
apply to the Fund but not the Index. The Adviser expects that, over time, the correlation between the Fund’s performance and that
of the Index, before fees and expenses, will be 95% or better. If the Fund uses a replication strategy, it can be expected to have greater
correlation to the Index than if it uses a representative sampling strategy.</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">The Fund is considered to be non-diversified, which
means that it may invest more of its assets in the securities of a single issuer or a smaller number of issuers than if it were a diversified
fund. To the extent the Index is concentrated (i.e., holds 25% or more of its total assets) in a particular industry or group of industries,
the Fund is expected to be concentrated in that industry or group of industries to approximately the same extent that the Index concentrates
in an industry or group of industries. [As of May __, 2023, a significant portion of the Index is represented by securities of companies
in the luxury industry and the consumer discretionary sector.] The degree to which Index Components represent certain sectors or industries
may&nbsp;change over time.&#8195;</p>

of products and/or services that contribute to the agricultural industry. Companies are only eligible for inclusion in the Index if they
generate at least 50% of their revenues from agricultural related business operations. This may include companies involved in the following:
1) agricultural production – includes companies engaged in the production and distribution of crops and animal products, including
fresh fruit and vegetable products, live animals, eggs, seeds and other agricultural commodities, animal feed and farm animal veterinary
products; 2) agricultural machinery - includes companies that are involved in the production and distribution of equipment which supports
the agriculture industry. This includes irrigation, seeding, and tillage equipment, specialized storage solutions, and as innovative technologies
and equipment designed to improve agricultural output and sustainability; 3) agricultural chemicals &amp; fuels – includes companies
that are involved in the development and production of chemicals and fuels that support the agriculture industry. This includes fertilizers,
crop protection products, crop nutrients, insect control products, and biofuels; and 4) agriscience &amp; technology – includes
companies involved in crop monitoring, planting, management, and harvesting, as well as precision agriculture, digital farming, and smart
agriculture, including research and development of crop nutrition and plant science. This also comprises the production of agricultural
equipment, crop yield maximization, agritech, agribusiness, and sustainable farming practices. Each company identified by ARTIS<sup>®

by the Index Provider and companies are removed from the selection process if they don’t have business operations consistent with
the Index’s agricultural theme. The remaining companies are ranked by their score (in descending order)</font> and the top 35 companies

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">The Fund will invest, under normal circumstances,
at least 80% of its net assets, plus the amount of any borrowings for investment purposes, in securities that comprise the Index and in
American Depositary Receipts (“ADRs”) and Global Depositary Receipts (“GDRs”) based on the securities in the Index
(the “80% Policy”). The Index may include securities of large-, mid- and small-capitalization companies. The Fund's 80% Policy
is non-fundamental and requires 60 days prior written notice to shareholders before it can be changed.</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">The Fund uses a “passive” or indexing
approach to try to achieve the Fund’s investment objective. Unlike many investment companies, the Fund does not try to beat the
Index and does not seek temporary defensive positions when markets decline or appear overvalued. Indexing may eliminate the chance that
the Fund will substantially outperform the Index but also may reduce some of the risks of active management, such as poor security selection.
Indexing seeks to achieve lower costs and better after-tax performance by aiming to keep portfolio turnover low in comparison to actively
managed investment companies.</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">The Fund will generally use a “replication”
strategy to achieve its investment objective, meaning it will invest in all of the component securities of the Index in the same approximate
proportion as in the Index. However, the Fund may utilize a representative sampling strategy with respect to the Index when a replication
strategy might be detrimental or disadvantageous to shareholders, such as when there are practical difficulties or substantial costs involved
in compiling a portfolio of equity securities to replicate the Index, in instances in which a security in the Index becomes temporarily
illiquid, unavailable or less liquid, or as a result of legal restrictions or limitations (such as tax diversification requirements) that
apply to the Fund but not the Index. The Adviser expects that, over time, the correlation between the Fund’s performance and that
of the Index, before fees and expenses, will be 95% or better. If the Fund uses a replication strategy, it can be expected to have greater
correlation to the Index than if it uses a representative sampling strategy.</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">The Fund is considered to be non-diversified, which
means that it may invest more of its assets in the securities of a single issuer or a smaller number of issuers than if it were a diversified
fund. To the extent the Index is concentrated (i.e., holds 25% or more of its total assets) in a particular industry or group of industries,
the Fund is expected to be concentrated in that industry or group of industries to approximately the same extent that the Index concentrates
in an industry or group of industries. [As of May __, 2023, a significant portion of the Index is represented by securities of companies
in the chemicals and food products industries and had significant exposure to the agriculture production industry and the agriculture
and livestock, industrials and materials sectors.] The degree to which Index Components represent certain sectors or industries may&nbsp;change
over time.&#8195;</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">The Fund may lend securities representing up to one-third
of the value of the Fund’s total assets (including the value of any collateral received).</p>

investment is or becomes difficult or impossible to purchase or sell at an advantageous time and price. If a transaction is particularly
large or if the relevant market is or becomes illiquid, it may not be possible to initiate a transaction or liquidate a position, which
may cause the Fund to suffer significant losses and difficulties in meeting redemptions. Liquidity risk may be the result of, among other
things, market turmoil, the reduced number and capacity of traditional market participants, or the lack of an active trading market. Markets
for securities or financial instruments could be disrupted by a number of events, including, but not limited to, an economic crisis, natural
disasters, new legislation or regulatory changes inside or outside the U.S. Liquid investments may become less liquid after being purchased
by the Fund, particularly during periods of market stress. In addition, if a number of securities held by the Fund stop trading, it may
have a cascading effect and cause the Fund to halt trading. Volatility in market prices will increase the risk of the Fund being subject
to a trading halt. Certain countries in which the Fund may invest may be subject to extended settlement delays and/or foreign holidays,
during which the Fund will unlikely be able to convert holdings to cash.</td></tr></tbody></table>

costs and may result in higher taxes when Fund Shares are held in a taxable account. These costs, which are not reflected in annual fund
operating expenses or in the example, affect the Fund’s performance. Because the Fund is newly organized, portfolio turnover information

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">Based on the Index Universe, the initial composition
of the Index, as well as any selection for an ordinary rebalance, is determined on the Selection Day by first screening publicly available
information such as financial news, business profiles and company publications using the Index Provider’s proprietary natural language
processing algorithm (“ARTIS<sup>®</sup>”) to identify companies that have or are expected to have exposure to the provision
of products and/or services that contribute to AI related industries. Companies are only eligible for inclusion in the Index if they generate
at least 50% of their revenues from the following business fields: 1) artificial intelligence (AI) – comprises companies involved
in the provision of AI computing solutions, software for digital transformation, processors and services to a variety of industries such
as media, services industry, pharmaceutical and computers; 2) data analytics and big data – comprises companies involved in data-related
technologies such as data mining, predictive analytics, and machine learning. It also comprises companies engaged in the provision of
business specific process management and business solutions based on influent amounts of data and data analytics; 3) natural language
processing – comprises companies involved in delivering natural language processing, speech recognition, semantic networks, ontology
engineering, logic programming, cognitive science, and theory of mind. It also includes the provision of algorithm-based solutions for
machine learning; and 4) AI-driven services – comprises companies that develop and use AI-powered applications, such as chatbots,
virtual assistants, predictive analytics, marketing technology and recommendation engines, as well as those that produce hardware and
software components for AI systems, such as computer chips, graphics processing units, and specialized algorithms. Each company identified
by ARTIS<sup>® </sup>receives a score that reflects its exposure to the Index strategy. <font style="font-size: 11pt">This set of
companies is then reviewed by the Index Provider and companies are removed from the selection process if they don’t have relevant
business operations. The remaining companies are ranked by their score (in descending order)</font> and the top 40 companies are selected
for inclusion in the Index (“Index Components”). The determination of the Index Universe and the selection of Index Components
is made by the Index Provider based on its proprietary methodology.</p>

before the Rebalance Day. “Rebalance Day” is the last weekday in February and August. On each Selection Day, each security
in the Index Universe is assigned a score based on its exposure to AI related industries, with 1 representing the highest rank. The 40
highest ranked companies are selected as Index Components. Index Components are then assigned a ranking score, with the highest ranked
company receiving a ranking of 40, the second highest ranked company will receive a ranking score of 39 and so forth until the lowest
scoring company is ranked 1. Portfolio positions are weighted according to the Index Provider’s proprietary assessment of a company’s
relevance to the AI industry. Adjustments to the Index are made on Rebalance Day. The Index Components may change over time.</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">The Fund will invest, under normal circumstances,
at least 80% of its net assets, plus the amount of any borrowings for investment purposes, in securities that comprise the Index and in
American Depositary Receipts (“ADRs”) and Global Depositary Receipts (“GDRs”) based on the securities in the Index
(the “80% Policy”). The Index may include securities of large-, mid- and small-capitalization companies. The Fund's 80% Policy
is non-fundamental and requires 60 days prior written notice to shareholders before it can be changed.</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">The Fund uses a “passive” or indexing
approach to try to achieve the Fund’s investment objective. Unlike many investment companies, the Fund does not try to beat the
Index and does not seek temporary defensive positions when markets decline or appear overvalued. Indexing may eliminate the chance that
the Fund will substantially outperform the Index but also may reduce some of the risks of active management, such as poor security selection.
Indexing seeks to achieve lower costs and better after-tax performance by aiming to keep portfolio turnover low in comparison to actively
managed investment companies.</p>

strategy to achieve its investment objective, meaning it will invest in all of the component securities of the Index in the same approximate
proportion as in the Index. However, the Fund may utilize a representative sampling strategy with respect to the Index when a replication
strategy might be detrimental or disadvantageous to shareholders, such as when there are practical difficulties or substantial costs involved
in compiling a portfolio of equity securities to replicate the Index, in instances in which a security in the Index becomes temporarily
illiquid, unavailable or less liquid, or as a result of legal restrictions or limitations (such as tax diversification requirements) that
apply to the Fund but not the Index. The Adviser expects that, over time, the correlation between the Fund’s performance and that
of the Index, before fees and expenses, will be 95% or better. If the Fund uses a replication strategy, it can be expected to have greater
correlation to the Index than if it uses a representative sampling strategy.</p>

means that it may invest more of its assets in the securities of a single issuer or a smaller number of issuers than if it were a diversified
fund. To the extent the Index is concentrated (i.e., holds 25% or more of its total assets) in a particular industry or group of industries,
the Fund is expected to be concentrated in that industry or group of industries to approximately the same extent that the Index concentrates
in an industry or group of industries. [As of May __, 2023, a significant portion of the Index is represented by securities of companies
that have business operations in the artificial intelligence and data services, semiconductors, software, and internet industries and
in the information technology sector.] The degree to which components of the Index represent certain sectors or industries may change

These companies face intense competition and potentially rapid product obsolescence, and many depend significantly on retaining and growing
the consumer base of their respective products and services. Many of these companies are also reliant on the end user demand of products

in, or exposed to, artificial intelligence-related businesses and data services (as determined by the Index Provider) may be substantially
exposed to the market and business risks of other industries or sectors, and the Fund may be adversely affected by negative developments
impacting those companies, industries or sectors. In addition, these companies are heavily dependent on intellectual property rights and
may be adversely affected by loss or impairment of those rights. There can be no assurance that companies involved in artificial intelligence
and data services will be able to successfully protect their intellectual property to prevent the misappropriation of their technology,
or that competitors will not develop technology that is substantially similar or superior to such companies’ technology. Artificial
intelligence and data services companies are potential targets for cyberattacks, which can have a materially adverse impact on the performance
of these companies. In addition, the collection of data from consumers and other sources could face increased scrutiny as regulators consider
how the data is collected, stored, safeguarded and used. Artificial intelligence and data services companies may face regulatory fines

intelligence companies typically engage in significant amounts of spending on research and development, and there is no guarantee that

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">The Fund is an actively managed exchange-traded fund
(“ETF”) that will invest in the equity securities of companies that operate in the global banking sector. Under normal circumstances,
the Fund will invest at least 80% of its net assets, plus the amount of any borrowings for investment purposes, in securities that are
part of the global banking sector and in American Depositary Receipts (“ADRs”) and Global Depositary Receipts (“GDRs”)
that represent such companies in the banking sector (the “80% Policy”). The banks included in the Fund’s portfolio will
generally be classified as large-capitalization companies.</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">The Fund’s investment universe will include
all banks included in the list of Global Systemically Important Banks (“G-SIBs”), published annually by the Financial Stability
Board. Currently, there are 29 banks that are classified as G-SIBs. The Fund’s investment adviser, Themes Management Company, LLC
(the “Adviser”) will manage the Fund’s portfolio by investing the Fund’s assets on an equally weighted basis in
the equity securities issued by the G-SIB banks. The banks selected for investment by the Fund are selected solely based on their classification
as G-SIBs. The Adviser expects to rebalance the Fund’s portfolio on a quarterly basis and will do an annual reconstitution of the
portfolio, as applicable.</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">G-SIBs are banks that are believed to be so systemically
important to the global banking system that the bank’s failure could trigger a wider financial crisis and threaten the global economy.
The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (“BCBS”), which is considered the primary global standard setter for the prudential
regulation of banks, is responsible for identifying G-SIBs. BCBS consists of 45 members representing central bank and bank supervisors
from 28 jurisdictions. BCBS has developed an indicator-based measurement approach to identify G-SIBs. A G-SIB designation does not represent
an investment recommendation by BCBS, but it is designed to identify those banks that are systemically important to the global banking
system. The measurement approach, which is risk based, considers the following five categories and the underlying indicators of each category,
as applicable:</p>

of the banks</i></b> – A bank’s distress or failure is more likely to damage the global economy or financial markets if its
activities comprise a large share of global activity. The larger the bank, the more difficult it is for its activities to be quickly replaced
by other banks and therefore the greater the chance that its distress or failure would cause disruption to the financial markets in which
it operates. The distress or failure of a large bank is also more likely to damage confidence in the financial system as a whole. Size
is therefore a key measure of systemic importance.</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0 0 0 0.25in; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0 0 0 0.25in; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in"><b>2. <i>Interconnectedness
</i></b>– Financial distress at one institution can materially increase the likelihood of distress at other institutions given the
network of contractual obligations in which these firms operate. A bank’s systemic impact is likely to be positively related to
its interconnectedness vis-à-vis other financial institutions. Three indicators are used to measure interconnectedness: (i) intra-financial
system assets; (ii) intra-financial system liabilities; and (iii) securities outstanding. All three indicators include insurance subsidiaries
of a bank in their measurements.</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0 0 0 0.25in; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in"><b>3. <i>Substitutability/financial
institution infrastructure </i></b>- The systemic impact of a bank’s distress or failure is expected to be negatively related to
its degree of substitutability as both a market participant and a client service provider. For example, the greater a bank’s role
in a particular business line, or as a service provider in underlying market infrastructure (e.g., payment systems), the larger the disruption
will likely be following its failure, in terms of both service gaps and reduced flow of market and infrastructure liquidity. At the same
time, the cost to the failed bank’s customers in having to seek the same service from another institution is likely to be higher
for a failed bank with relatively greater market share in providing the service. Four indicators are used to measure substitutability/financial
institution infrastructure: (i) assets under custody; (ii) payments activity; (iii) underwritten transactions in debt and equity markets;
and (iv) trading volume.</p>

activity</i></b> - The objective of this indicator is to capture banks’ global footprint. Two indicators in this category measure
the importance of the bank’s activities outside its home (headquarter) jurisdiction relative to overall activity of other banks
in the sample: (i) cross-jurisdictional claims; and (ii) cross-jurisdictional liabilities. The idea is that the international impact of
a bank’s distress or failure would vary in line with its share of cross-jurisdictional assets and liabilities. The greater a bank’s
global reach, the more difficult it is to coordinate its resolution and the more widespread the spillover effects from its failure.</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0 0 0 0.25in; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in"><b>5. <i>Complexity</i></b>
The systemic impact of a bank’s distress or failure is expected to be positively related to its overall complexity – that
is, its business, structural and operational complexity. The more complex a bank is, the greater the costs and time needed to resolve
the matters impacting the bank. Three indicators are used to measure complexity: (i) notional amount of OTC derivatives; (ii) amount of
level 3 assets; and (iii) trading and available-for-sale securities. The first two indicators include insurance subsidiaries of a bank
in their measurements.</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">In constructing its indicator-based measurement approach,
BCBS has allocated a 20% weight to each of the broad categories and within all the broad categories, excluding the size category, unique
indicators have been identified and assigned a specific weighting. For the cross-jurisdictional category, BCBS has identified two indicators,
cross-jurisdictional claims (10%) and cross-jurisdictional liabilities (10%) that it considers when analyzing a bank. The category interconnectedness
has been broken down into three indicators, intra-financial assets (6.67%), intra-financial system liabilities (6.67%) and securities

measurement approach uses a large sample of banks as its proxy for the global banking sector. Data supplied by this sample of banks are
then used to calculate banks’ scores. Banks fulfilling any of the following criteria are included in the sample:</font> b<font style="font-size: 11pt">anks
that the BCBS identifies as the 75 largest global banks, based on the financial year-end Basel III leverage ratio exposure measure, including
exposures arising from insurance subsidiaries; banks that were designated as G-SIBs in the previous year (unless supervisors agree that
there is a compelling reason to exclude them); and banks that have been added to the sample by national supervisors using supervisory
judgment (subject to certain criteria).</font></p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">For each bank, the score for a particular indicator
is calculated by dividing the individual bank amount (expressed in EUR) by the aggregate amount for the indicator summed across all banks
in the sample.&nbsp;This amount is then multiplied by 10,000 to express the indicator score in terms of basis points. For example, if
a bank’s size divided by the total size of all banks in the sample is 0.03 (i.e., the bank makes up 3% of the sample total) its
score will be expressed as 300 basis points. Each category score for each bank is determined by taking a simple average of the indicator
scores in that category. The overall score for each bank is then calculated by taking a simple average of its five category scores and
then rounding to the nearest whole basis point.&nbsp;The maximum total score, the score that a bank would have if it were the only bank
in sample, is 10,000 basis points (i.e., 100%).</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">Banks that have a score produced by the indicator-based
measurement approach that exceeds a cutoff level (currently at 130 basis points) set by BCBS are classified as G-SIBs. Supervisory judgment
may also be used to add banks with scores below the cutoff to the list of G-SIBs. This judgment is exercised according to the principles
set out by BCBS. Each year, BCBS runs the assessment and, if necessary, reallocates G-SIBs into different categories of systemic importance
based on their scores.</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">G-SIBs are allocated into equally sized buckets based
on their scores of systemic importance, with varying levels of higher loss absorbency (“HLA”) requirements applied to the
different buckets. There are currently five different buckets (1-5), with the top bucket (5) initially being empty. As banks move into
the top bucket (5), a new bucket will be added to maintain incentives for banks to avoid becoming more systemically important. It should
be noted that the number of G-SIBs, and their bucket allocation, evolves over time as banks change their behavior in response to the incentives
of the G-SIB framework as well as other aspects of Basel III and country-specific regulations.</p>

significant levels of debt and Chinese financial institutions currently hold relatively large amounts of non-performing debt. Thus, there
exists a possibility that widespread defaults could occur, which could trigger a financial crisis, freeze Chinese debt and finance markets
and make Chinese securities illiquid.</p>

than rank number 2. The companies with the highest ranks are then chosen as Index Components and the new index composition determined
this way is valid starting the business day immediately following the last business day in February (“Adjustment Day”). Selection
Day is the business day 10 business days before the Adjustment Day.</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">The minimum number of Index Components is 20 and the
maximum number of Index Components is 30. The Index Provider may decide to increase the maximum number of Index Components on a Selection
Day. In case the rank assigned to a company which is an existing Index Component on a Selection Day is not sufficient to be selected as
an Index Component, it shall only be removed from the Index if its rank exceeds the maximum number of Index Components by more than 10
ranks. The company with the lowest rank which is selected as an Index Component on this Selection Day but which is not currently an Index

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">The composition of the Index is ordinarily adjusted
once a year on Adjustment Day after the close of business. The composition of the Index is reviewed on the Selection Day and the appropriate
decision made is announced. On each Selection Day and on the business day five business days before the last business day in August (
“Reweighting Day”), each Index Component of the Index is weighted proportionally according to its free float market capitalization.
The percentage weight of each Index Component is capped at 4.75% on the Selection Days and on the business days five business days before
the Reweighting Days. The excess weight is allocated proportionally to all Index Components whose percentage weight is not capped at 4.75%.
The new index composition and weightings are implemented after the close of trading on the Adjustment Day and Reweighting Day. The cumulative
Percentage Weight of the Index Components which do not fulfil the Liquidity Criterion is capped at 10% on the Adjustment Days and on the

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">The Fund uses a “passive” or indexing
approach. Unlike many investment companies, the Fund does not try to beat the Index and does not seek temporary defensive positions when
markets decline or appear overvalued. Indexing may eliminate the chance that the Fund will substantially outperform the Index but also
may reduce some of the risks of active management, such as poor security selection. Indexing seeks to achieve lower costs and better after-tax
performance by aiming to keep portfolio turnover low in comparison to actively managed investment companies.</p>

strategy to achieve its investment objective, meaning it will invest in all of the component securities of the Index in the same approximate
proportion as in the Index. However, the Fund may utilize a representative sampling strategy with respect to the Index when a replication
strategy might be detrimental or disadvantageous to shareholders, such as when there are practical difficulties or substantial costs involved
in compiling a portfolio of equity securities to replicate the Index, in instances in which a security in the Index becomes temporarily
illiquid, unavailable or less liquid, or as a result of legal restrictions or limitations (such as tax diversification requirements) that
apply to the Fund but not the Index. The Adviser expects that, over time, the correlation between the Fund’s performance and that
of the Index, before fees and expenses, will be 95% or better. If the Fund uses a replication strategy, it can be expected to have greater
correlation to the Index than if it uses a representative sampling strategy.</p>

the Fund is expected to be concentrated in that industry or group of industries to approximately the same extent that the Index concentrates

The Chinese securities markets are subject to more frequent trading halts, low trading volume and price volatility. Recent developments in relations between the United States and China have heightened concerns of increased tariffs and restrictions on trade between the two countries. An increase in tariffs or trade restrictions, or even the threat of such developments, could lead to a significant reduction in international trade, which could have a negative impact on China’s export industry and a commensurately negative impact on the Fund.</p>

Thus, there exists a possibility that widespread defaults could occur, which could trigger a financial crisis, freeze Chinese debt and finance markets and make Chinese securities illiquid.</p>
                                                                                <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;</p>

Worsening trade relations between the two countries could adversely impact the Fund, particularly to the extent that the Chinese government restricts foreign investments in on-shore Chinese companies or the U.S. government restricts investments by U.S. investors in China. Worsening trade relations may also result in market volatility and volatility in the price of Fund shares.</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">The Fund is an ETF. This means that individual Shares
of the Fund may only be purchased and sold in the secondary market through brokers at market prices, rather than NAV. Because Shares trade
at market prices rather than NAV, Shares may trade at a price greater than NAV (premium) or less than NAV (discount).</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">The Fund generally issues and redeems shares at NAV
only in large blocks of shares known as “Creation Units,” which only institutions or large investors may purchase or redeem.
The Fund generally issues and redeems Creation Units in exchange for a portfolio of securities (the “Deposit Securities”)
and/or a designated amount of U.S. cash that the Fund specifies each day.</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">Investors may incur costs attributable to the difference
between the highest price a buyer is willing to pay to purchase Shares (bid) and the lowest price a seller is willing to accept for Shares
(ask) when buying or selling Shares in the secondary market (the “bid-ask spread”). Recent information about the Fund, including
its net asset value, market price, premiums and discounts, and bid-ask spreads is available on the Fund’s website at www.ThemesETFs.com.</p>

the Index, the Parent Index is further screened for the following criteria: 1) a company must be classified under any of the following
industries based on the FactSet Revere Business Industry Classification System (“RBICS”): 3D Modeling/Rapid Prototyping Automation

revenues within the aggregate of the RBICS industries listed above in criteria 1; 3) only the most liquid share class of a multi-share
class company will be eligible for inclusion in the Index; and 4) a company must be compliant with the Sustainalytics Global Standards
Screening assessment. Global Standards Screening identifies companies that are in violation or are at risk of violating commonly accepted
international norms and standards, enshrined in the United Nations Global Compact (UNGC) Principles, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation
and Development (OECD) Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises, the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (UNGPs, and their

are weighted proportionally to the free-float market capitalization of the security multiplied by the aggregate revenue exposure of the

in June and the review cut-off date is the last dissemination day of the preceding month. The Index applies an index cap weighting process
as it relates to the Index Components and this process is performed quarterly in March, June, September, and December and is published
on the second Friday of each of these months. Each Index Component’s capped weight is derived from the initial weights via an iterative
process that seeks to maintain the sum of all weights above 4.5% to 35% of the overall Index with no single weight to exceed 8% of the
overall Index. Any excess weights are redistributed from the relevant Index Component(s) to the other Index Components that are not subject
to the above cap limitations, proportionally to their current weight in the Index. This process is designed to increase company-level
diversification.</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">The Fund will invest, under normal circumstances,
at least 80% of its net assets, plus the amount of any borrowings for investment purposes, in in the securities that comprise the Index
and in American Depositary Receipts (“ADRs”) and Global Depositary Receipts (“GDRs”) based on the securities in
the Index (the “80% Policy”). Such securities may include those of large-, mid- and small-capitalization companies. As it
relates to the remaining 20% of the Fund’s net assets, the Fund may invest in certain other exchange-traded funds that provide exposure
to companies that stand to benefit from the technological advancement leading to a new industrial revolution. This will include exposure
to companies that are generating revenue from the technological segments such as cybersecurity, virtual reality or the Internet of Things.
In addition, the Adviser may allocate a portion of the Fund’s net assets to cash and cash equivalents, money market funds, and other
short-term instruments. The Fund's 80% Policy is non-fundamental and requires 60 days prior written notice to shareholders before it can
be changed.</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">The Fund uses a “passive” or indexing
approach to try to achieve the Fund’s investment objective. Unlike many investment companies, the Fund does not try to beat the
Index and does not seek temporary defensive positions when markets decline or appear overvalued. Indexing may eliminate the chance that
the Fund will substantially outperform the Index but also may reduce some of the risks of active management, such as poor security selection.
Indexing seeks to achieve lower costs and better after-tax performance by aiming to keep portfolio turnover low in comparison to actively
managed investment companies.</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">The Adviser uses a representative sampling indexing
strategy to manage the Fund. “Representative sampling” is an indexing strategy that involves investing in a representative
sample of securities that collectively has an investment profile similar to that of the Index. The securities selected are expected to
have, in the aggregate, investment characteristics (based on factors such as market capitalization and industry weightings), fundamental
characteristics (such as return variability and yield) and liquidity measures similar to those of the Index. The Fund may or may not hold
all of the securities in the Index.</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">The Fund is considered to be non-diversified, which
means that it may invest more of its assets in the securities of a single issuer or a smaller number of issuers than if it were a diversified
fund. To the extent the Index is concentrated (i.e., holds 25% or more of its total assets) in a particular industry or group of industries,
the Fund is expected to be concentrated in that industry or group of industries to approximately the same extent that the Index concentrates
in an industry or group of industries. [As of May __, 2023, a significant portion of the Index is represented by securities of companies
in the internet, semiconductor and software industries and information technology sector.] The degree to which components of the Index
represent certain sectors or industries may change over time.</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">The Fund employs a “passive management”
(or indexing) investment approach designed to track the performance, before fees and expenses, of the STOXX Global Junior Gold Miners
Index, or any successor thereto (the “Index”). The Index is a rules-based equity index developed and maintained by STOXX Ltd.
(the “Index Provider”), which is an organization that is independent of, and unaffiliated with, the Fund and Themes Management
Company, LLC, the Fund’s investment adviser (the “Adviser”).</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">The Index is designed to provide exposure to global
companies in the small-capitalization segment that are active in the gold mining industry. The Index is denominated in US dollars. [As
of May __, 2023, the Index was comprised of __ companies with a market capitalization range of between approximately $_____ million and
$_____ billion and a weighted average market capitalization of $___ billion.]</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">In constructing or adjusting the Index, the Index
Provider identifies an “Index Universe” of companies that, on Selection Day (as defined below), fulfill the following requirements:
1) are a part/component of the STOXX World AC Small Cap Index (a free float market capitalization-weighted index designed to measure the
performance of small-capitalization companies, as calculated by the Index Provider, from developed markets and emerging markets covering
approximately 15% of the investable market capitalization); 2) have a three month Average Daily Traded Value (ADTV) greater than $1 million;
and 3) have more than 50% of revenues generated within the sectors associated with the gold mining theme as defined by FactSet RBICS (e.g.,
Other North America Gold Ore Mining, Latin America Gold Ore Mining, Pan-Asia Gold Ore Mining, Other Americas Gold Ore Mining, United States
Gold Ore Mining, Australia Gold Ore Mining, South Africa Gold Ore Mining, Rest of Asia Gold Ore Mining, China Gold Ore Mining, Canada
Gold Ore Mining, Europe Gold Ore Mining, Southeast Asia Gold Ore Mining, Other Africa Gold Ore Mining, Multinational Gold Ore Mining,
Multiple Precious Metals Ore Mining and Russia and CIS Gold Ore Mining). The revenue threshold is lowered to 45% for existing constituents.
The Index aims to have a minimum number of 50 constituents at each review (“Index Components”). If the screening process described
above results in being too restrictive, the revenue filter is progressively lowered in steps of 5% for the Index, to a minimum of 30%
(25% for current Index Components), until the number of Index Components is equal to or greater than 50.</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">The Fund will invest, under normal circumstances,
at least 80% of its net assets, plus the amount of any borrowings for investment purposes, in in the securities that comprise the Index
and in American Depositary Receipts (“ADRs”) and Global Depositary Receipts (“GDRs”) based on the securities in
the Index (the “80% Policy”). Such securities may include those of mid- and small-capitalization companies from developed
and emerging market countries. The Fund's 80% Policy is non-fundamental and requires 60 days prior written notice to shareholders before
it can be changed.</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">The Fund uses a “passive” or indexing
approach. Unlike many investment companies, the Fund does not try to beat the Index and does not seek temporary defensive positions when
markets decline or appear overvalued. Indexing may eliminate the chance that the Fund will substantially outperform the Index but also
may reduce some of the risks of active management, such as poor security selection. Indexing seeks to achieve lower costs and better after-tax
performance by aiming to keep portfolio turnover low in comparison to actively managed investment companies.</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">The Fund will generally use a “replication”
strategy to achieve its investment objective, meaning it will invest in all of the component securities of the Index in the same approximate
proportion as in the Index. However, the Fund may utilize a representative sampling strategy with respect to the Index when a replication
strategy might be detrimental or disadvantageous to shareholders, such as when there are practical difficulties or substantial costs involved
in compiling a portfolio of equity securities to replicate the Index, in instances in which a security in the Index becomes temporarily
illiquid, unavailable or less liquid, or as a result of legal restrictions or limitations (such as tax diversification requirements or
sanctions imposed by the U.S. government) that apply to the Fund but not the Index. The Adviser expects that, over time, the correlation
between the Fund’s performance and that of the Index, before fees and expenses, will be 95% or better. If the Fund uses a replication
strategy, it can be expected to have greater correlation to the Index than if it uses a representative sampling strategy.</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">The Fund is considered to be non-diversified, which
means that it may invest more of its assets in the securities of a single issuer or a smaller number of issuers than if it were a diversified
fund. To the extent the Index is concentrated (i.e., holds 25% or more of its total assets) in a particular industry or group of industries,
the Fund is expected to be concentrated in that industry or group of industries to approximately the same extent that the Index concentrates
in an industry or group of industries. As of [May __, 2023, the gold mining industry and materials sector represented a significant portion
of the Index.] The degree to which components of the Index represent certain sectors or industries may change over time.</p>

resources. The Canadian market is relatively concentrated in issuers involved in the production and distribution of natural resources.
There is a risk that any changes in natural resources sectors could have an adverse impact on the Canadian economy. Additionally, the
Canadian economy is heavily dependent on relationships with certain key trading partners including the United States, countries in the

higher volatility from time to time in comparison to developed markets. China may be subject to considerable degrees of economic, political
and social instability. Over the last few decades, the Chinese government has undertaken reform of economic and market practices and has
expanded the sphere of private ownership of property in China. However, Chinese markets generally continue to experience inefficiency,
volatility and pricing anomalies resulting from governmental influence, a lack of publicly available information and/or political and
social instability. Chinese companies are also subject to the risk that Chinese authorities can intervene in their operations and structure.
In addition, the Chinese economy is export-driven and highly reliant on trading with key partners. A downturn in the economies of China’s

                                            to possible regulatory and economic interventions by the Brazilian government, including
                                            the imposition of wage and price controls and the limitation of imports. The economy of Brazil
                                            has historically been negatively affected by corruption scandals involving private companies
                                            and government officials, which have led to sanctions against firms. In addition, the market
                                            for Brazilian securities is directly influenced by the flow of international capital and

                                            rates of inflation and a high level of debt, each of which may reduce and/or prevent economic

(or indexing) investment approach designed to track the performance, before fees and expenses, of the Solactive Natural Monopoly Index
(the “Index”). The Index is based on a proprietary methodology developed and maintained by Solactive AG (the “Index

the Fund’s investment adviser (the “Adviser”).</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">In constructing or adjusting the Index, the Index
Provider identifies an “Index Universe” of companies that, on Selection Days (as defined below), fulfill the following requirements:
1) are a part/component of the Solactive GBS (Global Benchmark Series) Developed Markets Large &amp; Mid Cap USD Index (an index developed
and maintained by the Index Provider that intends to track the performance of the large- and mid- capitalization segment covering approximately
85% of the free-float market capitalization in the developed markets (as identified by the Index Provider): <i>Australia, Austria, Belgium,

at least $1 million for new components of the Index (“Index Components”) and $750,000 for current Index Components over the
1 month and over 6 months prior to and including the Selection Day. The Average Daily Value Traded for a security is the sum of daily
value traded over the specified period divided by the number of trading days that fall in the specified period; 3) new (current) Index
Components must maintain a volume traded of at least 100,000 (75,000) shares over the 1 month period prior to and including the Selection
Day and 600,000 (450,000) shares over the preceding 6 month period prior to and including Selection Day; 4) new (current) Index Components

Float Market Capitalization (shares outstanding for a specific class multiplied by the closing price of the security) of at least $1 billion
($750 million). Free Float represents the share-class specific fraction of the total number of shares of such share class issued that

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">Based on the Index Universe, the initial composition
of the Index, as well as any selection for an ordinary rebalance, is determined on the Selection Day by first screening a company for
the following fundamental financial metrics: 1) sales; 2) profit margin; 3) profit margin volatility (over 3 years); 4) return on equity;
5) return on equity volatility (over 3 years); 6) inventory/total assets; and 7) intangible assets/total assets. All of these fundamental
financial metrics for a company must be available for consideration in order to be considered for the Index. Companies are ranked according
to all of these financial metrics using a proprietary methodology with the top 5 companies within each sector being selected for the Index.
Sectors are based on FactSet’s Level 2 Sector Classification system and companies included in FactSet’s Miscellaneous Sector
are excluded from the Index. In addition, China A Shares are excluded from the Index. On each Selection Day, each Component of the Index
(“Index Component”) is assigned a weight that is sector-neutral relative to the free float market capitalization of the Index
Universe. Within each sector, the weights of the Index Components are equally distributed. The determination of the Index Universe and
the selection of Index Components is made by the Index Provider based on its proprietary methodology.</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">The Fund will invest, under normal circumstances,
at least 80% of its net assets, plus the amount of any borrowings for investment purposes, in securities that comprise the Index and in
American Depositary Receipts (“ADRs”) and Global Depositary Receipts (“GDRs”) based on the securities in the Index
(the “80% Policy”). The Index may include securities of large-, mid- and small-capitalization companies. The Fund's 80% Policy
is non-fundamental and requires 60 days prior written notice to shareholders before it can be changed.</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">The Fund uses a “passive” or indexing
approach to try to achieve the Fund’s investment objective. Unlike many investment companies, the Fund does not try to beat the
Index and does not seek temporary defensive positions when markets decline or appear overvalued. Indexing may eliminate the chance that
the Fund will substantially outperform the Index but also may reduce some of the risks of active management, such as poor security selection.
Indexing seeks to achieve lower costs and better after-tax performance by aiming to keep portfolio turnover low in comparison to actively
managed investment companies.</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">The Fund will generally use a “replication”
strategy to achieve its investment objective, meaning it will invest in all of the component securities of the Index in the same approximate
proportion as in the Index. However, the Fund may utilize a representative sampling strategy with respect to the Index when a replication
strategy might be detrimental or disadvantageous to shareholders, such as when there are practical difficulties or substantial costs involved
in compiling a portfolio of equity securities to replicate the Index, in instances in which a security in the Index becomes temporarily
illiquid, unavailable or less liquid, or as a result of legal restrictions or limitations (such as tax diversification requirements) that
apply to the Fund but not the Index. The Adviser expects that, over time, the correlation between the Fund’s performance and that
of the Index, before fees and expenses, will be 95% or better. If the Fund uses a replication strategy, it can be expected to have greater
correlation to the Index than if it uses a representative sampling strategy.</p>

and social instability. Over the last few decades, the Chinese government has undertaken reform of economic and market practices and has
expanded the sphere of private ownership of property in China. However, Chinese markets generally continue to experience inefficiency,
volatility and pricing anomalies resulting from governmental influence, a lack of publicly available information and/or political and
social instability. Chinese companies are also subject to the risk that Chinese authorities can intervene in their operations and structure.
In addition, the Chinese economy is export-driven and highly reliant on trading with key partners. A downturn in the economies of China’s
primary trading partners could slow or eliminate the growth of the Chinese economy and adversely impact the Fund’s investments.
The Chinese government strictly regulates the payment of foreign currency denominated obligations and sets monetary policy. The Chinese

(or indexing) investment approach designed to track the performance, before fees and expenses, of the Solactive Renewable Energy Index
(the “Index”). The Index is based on a proprietary methodology developed and maintained by Solactive AG (the “Index

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">The Index is a free float adjusted, market capitalization

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">In constructing or adjusting the Index, the Index
Provider identifies an “Index Universe” of companies that, on Selection Days (as defined below), fulfill the following requirements:
1) are a part/component of the Solactive Global Benchmark Series (“GBS”) index universe of the Solactive GBS Developed Markets
All Cap USD Index (an index developed and maintained by the Index Provider that intends to track the performance of the all cap covering
approximately the largest 100% of the free-float market capitalization in Developed Markets (as identified by the Index Provider): Australia,
Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway,
Poland, Portugal, Singapore, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and the United States), 2) are a part/component of the Solactive
GBS index universe of the Solactive GBS Global Markets Renewable Energy All Cap USD Index which consists of companies involved in wind
energy, solar energy, renewable energy equipment and technology and green utilities, and 3) have an Average Daily Value Traded of at least
$1 million over 1 month and over 6 months prior to and including the Selection Day. The Average Daily Value Traded for a security is the
sum of daily value traded over the specified period divided by the number of trading days that fall in the specified period. Only one
share class of each company is eligible for inclusion in the Index Universe. The eligible share class is the share class with the higher
minimum Average Daily Value Traded over 1 month and over 6 months prior to and including the Selection Day. Based on the Index Universe,
the initial composition of the Index, as well as any selection for an ordinary rebalance, is determined on the Selection Day by ranking
all eligible securities based on their free float market capitalization in a descending order and selecting the top 50 securities (if
50 companies are eligible for purchase) for inclusion in the Index (each, an “Index Component”). The determination of the
Index Universe and the selection of Index Components is made by the Index Provider based on its proprietary methodology. “Selection
Day” is 20 business days before the Rebalance Day. “Rebalance Day” is the first Wednesday in February, May, August and
November.</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">The Fund will invest, under normal circumstances,
at least 80% of its net assets, plus the amount of any borrowings for investment purposes, in securities that comprise the Index and in
American Depositary Receipts (“ADRs”) and Global Depositary Receipts (“GDRs”) based on the securities in the Index
(the “80% Policy”). The Index may include securities of large-, mid- and small-capitalization companies. The Fund's 80% Policy
is non-fundamental and requires 60 days prior written notice to shareholders before it can be changed.</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">The Fund uses a “passive” or indexing
approach to try to achieve the Fund’s investment objective. Unlike many investment companies, the Fund does not try to beat the
Index and does not seek temporary defensive positions when markets decline or appear overvalued. Indexing may eliminate the chance that
the Fund will substantially outperform the Index but also may reduce some of the risks of active management, such as poor security selection.
Indexing seeks to achieve lower costs and better after-tax performance by aiming to keep portfolio turnover low in comparison to actively
managed investment companies.</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">The Fund will generally use a “replication”
strategy to achieve its investment objective, meaning it will invest in all of the component securities of the Index in the same approximate
proportion as in the Index. However, the Fund may utilize a representative sampling strategy with respect to the Index when a replication
strategy might be detrimental or disadvantageous to shareholders, such as when there are practical difficulties or substantial costs involved
in compiling a portfolio of equity securities to replicate the Index, in instances in which a security in the Index becomes temporarily
illiquid, unavailable or less liquid, or as a result of legal restrictions or limitations (such as tax diversification requirements or
sanctions imposed by the U.S. government) that apply to the Fund but not the Index. The Adviser expects that, over time, the correlation
between the Fund’s performance and that of the Index, before fees and expenses, will be 95% or better. If the Fund uses a replication
strategy, it can be expected to have greater correlation to the Index than if it uses a representative sampling strategy.</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">The Fund is considered to be non-diversified, which
means that it may invest more of its assets in the securities of a single issuer or a smaller number of issuers than if it were a diversified
fund. To the extent the Index is concentrated (i.e., holds 25% or more of its total assets) in a particular industry or group of industries,
the Fund is expected to be concentrated in that industry or group of industries to approximately the same extent that the Index concentrates
in an industry or group of industries. [As of May __, 2023, issuers in the [clean energy industry and the energy and utilities] sectors
represented a significant portion of the Index.] The degree to which components of the Index represent certain sectors or industries may&nbsp;change

of investing in the Fund, see the section in the Fund’s prospectus entitled “Additional Information about the Principal Risks
of Investing in the Funds.” Each risk summarized below is considered a “principal risk” of investing in the Fund, regardless

following: general economic conditions or cyclical market patterns that could negatively affect supply and demand; competition for resources;
adverse labor relations; political or world events; obsolescence of technologies; and increased competition or new product introductions
that may affect the profitability or viability of companies in a particular industry. As a result, the value of the Fund’s investments
may rise and fall more than the value of shares of a fund that invests in securities of companies in a broader range of industries.</td></tr></tbody></table>

large or if the relevant market is or becomes illiquid, it may not be possible to initiate a transaction or liquidate a position, which
may cause the Fund to suffer significant losses and difficulties in meeting redemptions. Liquidity risk may be the result of, among other
things, market turmoil, the reduced number and capacity of traditional market participants, or the lack of an active trading market. Markets
for securities or financial instruments could be disrupted by a number of events, including, but not limited to, an economic crisis, natural
disasters, new legislation or regulatory changes inside or outside the U.S. Liquid investments may become less liquid after being purchased
by the Fund, particularly during periods of market stress. In addition, if a number of securities held by the Fund stop trading, it may
have a cascading effect and cause the Fund to halt trading. Volatility in market prices will increase the risk of the Fund being subject
to a trading halt. Certain countries in which the Fund may invest may be subject to extended settlement delays and/or foreign holidays,
during which the Fund will unlikely be able to convert holdings to cash.</td></tr></tbody></table>

when it buys and sells securities (or “turns over” its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover rate may indicate higher transaction

operating expenses or in the example, affect the Fund’s performance. Because the Fund is newly organized, portfolio turnover information

Provider identifies an “Index Universe” of companies that, on Selection Days (as defined below), fulfill the following requirements:
1) are listed on an exchange in a country classified as a developed country according to the Index Provider <i>(Australia, Austria, Belgium,
Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Portugal,
Singapore, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and the United States)</i>; 2) have a minimum Average Daily Value Traded of
at least $5,000,000 over 1 month and over 6 months prior to and including the Selection Day. The Average Daily Value Traded for an index
component is the sum of daily value traded over the specified period divided by the number of trading days that fall in the specified
period; 3) have a market capitalization of at least $1 billion; 4) have a free float percentage of at least 10%; and 5) be classified
in one of the following industries: Factory Automation Equipment; General Semiconductors; Industrial Machine Parts and Support Equipment;
Processor Semiconductors; Programmable Logic and ASIC Semiconductors; and Specialized Conductors.</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0 0 0 2.15pt; text-align: justify">The Index Provider further screens the
Index Universe based on the following criteria in order to determine the components of the Index (“Index Components”). On
the Selection Days, Index Components are selected by the Index Provider based on the following rules: 1) Companies with a negative total
return over the 12 month period preceding the Selection Day are excluded. The return realized on the Selection Day itself is included
in the calculation of the Total Return for each company; 2) All companies are ranked based on their security-level market capitalization
in descending order, such that those companies with the highest market capitalization receive the highest rank; and 3) The 30 highest
ranking companies are selected as Index Components subject to the constraint that not more than 9 companies from the same industry enter
the Index. In a situation where 9 companies from the same industry are already included in the Index and another company from this industry
is among the 30 highest-ranking stocks, the next highest-ranking company from another industry is included (if less than 9 stocks from
this other industry are included). Should the process above yield less than 30 index members, the following steps are applied: i. The
maximum number of stocks from each industry is increased from 9 to any number that allows to select 30 Index Components, ii. Instead of
excluding stocks with a negative 12-month Total Return (as defined above), these companies are eligible to be selected as Index Components.
In this case, the security with the smallest negative returns is allowed to be added to the Index first. This process is repeated until
30 Index Components are reached.</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0 0 0 2.15pt; text-align: justify">The composition of the Index is adjusted
quarterly. The composition of the Index is reviewed on the Selection Day and necessary changes are announced. “Selection Day”
is the first Friday in January, April, July, and October. Adjustment day is the second Friday in January, April, July and October. On
each Adjustment Day each Index Component is weighted equally. The determination of the Index Universe and the selection of Index Components
is made by the Index Provider based on its proprietary methodology. Index Components may change over time.</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">The Fund will invest, under normal circumstances,
at least 80% of its net assets, plus the amount of any borrowings for investment purposes, in securities that comprise the Index and in
American Depositary Receipts (“ADRs”) and Global Depositary Receipts (“GDRs”) based on the securities in the Index
(the “80% Policy”). Index securities include equity securities of companies that have business operations in factory automation
equipment, semiconductors, industrial machine parts, and programable logic devices and may include large-, mid- and small-capitalization
companies. The Fund's 80% Policy is non-fundamental and requires 60 days prior written notice to shareholders before it can be changed.</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">The Fund uses a “passive” or indexing
approach to try to achieve the Fund’s investment objective. Unlike many investment companies, the Fund does not try to beat the
Index and does not seek temporary defensive positions when markets decline or appear overvalued. Indexing may eliminate the chance that
the Fund will substantially outperform the Index but also may reduce some of the risks of active management, such as poor security selection.
Indexing seeks to achieve lower costs and better after-tax performance by aiming to keep portfolio turnover low in comparison to actively
managed investment companies.</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">The Fund will generally use a “replication”
strategy to achieve its investment objective, meaning it will invest in all of the component securities of the Index in the same approximate
proportion as in the Index. However, the Fund may utilize a representative sampling strategy with respect to the Index when a replication
strategy might be detrimental or disadvantageous to shareholders, such as when there are practical difficulties or substantial costs involved
in compiling a portfolio of equity securities to replicate the Index, in instances in which a security in the Index becomes temporarily
illiquid, unavailable or less liquid, or as a result of legal restrictions or limitations (such as tax diversification requirements) that
apply to the Fund but not the Index. The Adviser expects that, over time, the correlation between the Fund’s performance and that
of the Index, before fees and expenses, will be 95% or better. If the Fund uses a replication strategy, it can be expected to have greater
correlation to the Index than if it uses a representative sampling strategy.</p>

robotics and artificial intelligence-related businesses (as determined by the Index Provider) may be substantially exposed to the market

be able to successfully protect their intellectual property to prevent the misappropriation of their technology, or that competitors will

and social instability. Over the last few decades, the Chinese government has undertaken reform of economic and market practices and has
expanded the sphere of private ownership of property in China. However, Chinese markets generally continue to experience inefficiency,

The Chinese government strictly regulates the payment of foreign currency denominated obligations and sets monetary policy. The Chinese

American Depositary Receipts (“ADRs”) and Global Depositary Receipts (“GDRs”) based on the securities in the Index
(the “80% Policy”). Companies classified within the semiconductors industry include companies that either manufacture materials
that have electrical conductivity (semiconductors) to be used in electronic applications or utilize LED and OLED technology. The semiconductors
industry also includes companies that provide services or equipment associated with semiconductors such as packaging and testing. The

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">The Fund uses a “passive” or indexing
approach to try to achieve the Fund’s investment objective. Unlike many investment companies, the Fund does not try to beat the
Index and does not seek temporary defensive positions when markets decline or appear overvalued. Indexing may eliminate the chance that
the Fund will substantially outperform the Index but also may reduce some of the risks of active management, such as poor security selection.
Indexing seeks to achieve lower costs and better after-tax performance by aiming to keep portfolio turnover low in comparison to actively
managed investment companies.</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">The Fund will generally use a “replication”
strategy to achieve its investment objective, meaning it will invest in all of the component securities of the Index in the same approximate
proportion as in the Index. However, the Fund may utilize a representative sampling strategy with respect to the Index when a replication
strategy might be detrimental or disadvantageous to shareholders, such as when there are practical difficulties or substantial costs involved
in compiling a portfolio of equity securities to replicate the Index, in instances in which a security in the Index becomes temporarily
illiquid, unavailable or less liquid, or as a result of legal restrictions or limitations (such as tax diversification requirements) that
apply to the Fund but not the Index. The Adviser expects that, over time, the correlation between the Fund’s performance and that
of the Index, before fees and expenses, will be 95% or better. If the Fund uses a replication strategy, it can be expected to have greater
correlation to the Index than if it uses a representative sampling strategy.</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">The Fund is considered to be non-diversified, which
means that it may invest more of its assets in the securities of a single issuer or a smaller number of issuers than if it were a diversified
fund. To the extent the Index is concentrated (i.e., holds 25% or more of its total assets) in a particular industry or group of industries,
the Fund is expected to be concentrated in that industry or group of industries to approximately the same extent that the Index concentrates
in an industry or group of industries. [As of May __, 2023, a significant portion of the Index is represented by securities of companies
in the semiconductor industry and information technology sector.] The degree to which Index Components represent certain sectors or industries
may change over time.</p>

(or indexing) investment approach designed to track the performance, before fees and expenses, of the STOXX Global Silver Mining Index,
or any successor thereto (the “Index”). The Index is a rules-based equity index developed and maintained by STOXX Ltd. (the
“Index Provider”), which is an organization that is independent of, and unaffiliated with, the Fund and _______, the Fund’s

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">In constructing or adjusting the Index, the Index
Provider identifies an “Index Universe” of companies that, on Selection Day (as defined below), fulfill the following requirements:
1) are a part/component of the STOXX World AC All Cap Index (a free float market capitalization-weighted index designed to measure the
performance of large-, mid- and small- capitalization companies, as calculated by the Index Provider, that represent the top 85% of the
investable market capitalization of each developed and emerging market country included in the Index); 2) have three month Average Daily
Traded Value greater than $1 million; and 3) have significant market share based on absolute revenue generated within the Silver Ore Mining
sector as defined by FactSet RBICS (the “Index Components”). If the above screening process does not result in at least 50
Index Components, the Index Provider will consider all companies that were not initially selected for the Index that generate 25% or more
of their revenues within the Silver Ore Mining sector. These companies are then ranked by their revenue exposure from the highest to lowest
exposure to the sector until there are 50 stocks in the Index. At times, the Index may have less than 50 Index Components due to not enough
companies satisfying the screening process.</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">The Index Components are ranked according to their
free float market capitalization. The Index is then capped so that the maximum Index Component weight is no higher than 8% and companies
with a weight over 4.5% do not exceed 35% in aggregation. If a situation arises where capping is infeasible, the constituent companies
are equally weighted.</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">The composition of the Index is ordinarily reviewed
once a year in September (“Selection Day”). The Index Component weight factors are calculated quarterly in March, June, September,
and December. They are published on the second Friday of March, June, September, and December, based on the stocks’ closing prices
the preceding Thursday. The determination of the Index Universe and the selection of the Index Components of the Index is made by the
Index Provider based on its proprietary methodology.&nbsp;The Index Components may change over time.</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">The Fund will invest, under normal circumstances,
at least 80% of its net assets, plus the amount of any borrowings for investment purposes, in in the securities that comprise the Index
and in American Depositary Receipts (“ADRs”) and Global Depositary Receipts (“GDRs”) based on the securities in
the Index (the “80% Policy”). Such securities may include those of large-, mid- and small- capitalization companies from developed
and emerging market countries. The Fund's 80% Policy is non-fundamental and requires 60 days prior written notice to shareholders before
it can be changed.</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">The Fund uses a “passive” or indexing
approach. Unlike many investment companies, the Fund does not try to beat the Index and does not seek temporary defensive positions when
markets decline or appear overvalued. Indexing may eliminate the chance that the Fund will substantially outperform the Index but also
may reduce some of the risks of active management, such as poor security selection. Indexing seeks to achieve lower costs and better after-tax
performance by aiming to keep portfolio turnover low in comparison to actively managed investment companies.</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">The Fund will generally use a “replication”
strategy to achieve its investment objective, meaning it will invest in all of the component securities of the Index in the same approximate
proportion as in the Index. However, the Fund may utilize a representative sampling strategy with respect to the Index when a replication
strategy might be detrimental or disadvantageous to shareholders, such as when there are practical difficulties or substantial costs involved
in compiling a portfolio of equity securities to replicate the Index, in instances in which a security in the Index becomes temporarily
illiquid, unavailable or less liquid, or as a result of legal restrictions or limitations (such as tax diversification requirements) that
apply to the Fund but not the Index. The Adviser expects that, over time, the correlation between the Fund’s performance and that
of the Index, before fees and expenses, will be 95% or better. If the Fund uses a replication strategy, it can be expected to have greater
correlation to the Index than if it uses a representative sampling strategy.</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">The Fund is considered to be non-diversified, which
means that it may invest more of its assets in the securities of a single issuer or a smaller number of issuers than if it were a diversified
fund. To the extent the Index is concentrated (i.e., holds 25% or more of its total assets) in a particular industry or group of industries,
the Fund is expected to be concentrated in that industry or group of industries to approximately the same extent that the Index concentrates
in an industry or group of industries. [As of May __, 2023, companies in the silver mining industry and materials sector represented a
significant portion of the Index.] The degree to which components of the Index represent certain sectors or industries may change over
time.</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">In constructing or adjusting the Index, the Index
Provider identifies an “Index Universe” of companies that, on Selection Day (as defined below), fulfill the following requirements:
1) are a part/component of the STOXX World AC Index (a free float market capitalization-weighted index designed to measure the performance
of large-, mid- and small- capitalization companies, as calculated by the Index Provider, that represent the top 85% of the investable
market capitalization of each developed and emerging market country included in the index); 2) have free-float market capitalization greater
than $100 million; 3) have a three month Average Daily Traded Value (ADTV) greater than $1 million; 4) have more than 50% of revenues
generated within the sectors associated with the solar energy theme as defined by FactSet RBICS (e.g., China Solar Wholesale Power, United
States Solar Wholesale Power, Latin America Solar Wholesale Power, Europe Solar Wholesale Power, Middle East and Africa Solar Wholesale
Power, Other Asia/Pacific Solar Wholesale Power, Photovoltaic and Solar Cells and Systems Providers and Alternative Energy Infrastructure
Construction) (the “Index Components”). The revenue threshold is lowered to 45% for existing Index Components. The Index aims
to have a minimum number of 50 Index Components at each review. If the screening process described above results in being too restrictive,
the revenue filter is progressively lowered in steps of 5% for the Index, to a minimum of 30% (25% for current Index Components), until
the number of constituents is equal to or greater than 50.</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">The Index Components are ranked according to their
free float market capitalization. The Index is then capped so that the maximum Index Component weight is no higher than 8% and Index Components
with a weight over 4.5% do not exceed 35% in aggregation. If a situation arises where capping is infeasible, the Index Components are
equally weighted.</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">The composition of the Index is ordinarily reviewed
once a year in September (“Selection Day”). The Index Component weight factors are calculated quarterly in March, June, September,
and December. They are published on the second Friday of March, June, September, and December, based on the stocks’ closing prices
the preceding Thursday. The determination of the Index Universe and the selection of Index Components of the Index is made by the Index
Provider based on its proprietary methodology.&nbsp;The Index Components may change over time.</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">The Fund will invest, under normal circumstances,
at least 80% of its net assets, plus the amount of any borrowings for investment purposes, in in the securities that comprise the Index
and in American Depositary Receipts(“ADRs”) and Global Depositary Receipts (“GDRs”) based on the securities in
the Index (the “80% Policy”). Such securities may include those of large-, mid- and small- capitalization companies from developed
and emerging market countries. The Fund's 80% Policy is non-fundamental and requires 60 days prior written notice to shareholders before
it can be changed.</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">The Fund uses a “passive” or indexing
approach. Unlike many investment companies, the Fund does not try to beat the Index and does not seek temporary defensive positions when
markets decline or appear overvalued. Indexing may eliminate the chance that the Fund will substantially outperform the Index but also
may reduce some of the risks of active management, such as poor security selection. Indexing seeks to achieve lower costs and better after-tax
performance by aiming to keep portfolio turnover low in comparison to actively managed investment companies.</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">The Fund will generally use a “replication”
strategy to achieve its investment objective, meaning it will invest in all of the component securities of the Index in the same approximate
proportion as in the Index. However, the Fund may utilize a representative sampling strategy with respect to the Index when a replication
strategy might be detrimental or disadvantageous to shareholders, such as when there are practical difficulties or substantial costs involved
in compiling a portfolio of equity securities to replicate the Index, in instances in which a security in the Index becomes temporarily
illiquid, unavailable or less liquid, or as a result of legal restrictions or limitations (such as tax diversification requirements) that
apply to the Fund but not the Index. The Adviser expects that, over time, the correlation between the Fund’s performance and that
of the Index, before fees and expenses, will be 95% or better. If the Fund uses a replication strategy, it can be expected to have greater
correlation to the Index than if it uses a representative sampling strategy.</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">The Fund is considered to be non-diversified, which
means that it may invest more of its assets in the securities of a single issuer or a smaller number of issuers than if it were a diversified
fund. To the extent the Index is concentrated (i.e., holds 25% or more of its total assets) in a particular industry or group of industries,
the Fund is expected to be concentrated in that industry or group of industries to approximately the same extent that the Index concentrates
in an industry or group of industries. [As of May __, 2023, the solar energy distribution and related manufacturing industry and energy
and utilities sectors represented a significant portion of the Index.] The degree to which components of the Index represent certain sectors
or industries may change over time.</p>

of the value of the Fund’s total assets (including the value of any collateral received).</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">The Fund employs a “passive management”
(or indexing) investment approach designed to track the performance, before fees and expenses, of the Solactive US Cash Flow Champions
Index, or any successor thereto (the “Index”). The Index is based on a proprietary methodology developed and maintained by
Solactive AG (the “Index Provider”), which is an organization that is independent of, and unaffiliated with, the Fund and
Themes Management Company, LLC, the Fund’s investment adviser (the “Adviser”).</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">The Index is a free-float adjusted, market capitalization
weighted index that is designed to provide exposure to U.S. companies that have a high cash flow yield. The Index is denominated in US
dollars. [As of May __, 2023, the Index was comprised of __ companies with a market capitalization range of between approximately $__
billion and $___ billion and a weighted average market capitalization of approximately $___ billion.]</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">In constructing or adjusting the Index, the Index
Provider identifies an “Index Universe” of companies that, on Selection Days (as defined below), fulfill the following requirements:
1) is a member of the Solactive GBS (Global Benchmark Series) United States Large &amp; Mid Cap Index; and 2) only companies with a positive
cash flow yield (free cash flow/enterprise value) in the last 4 years are eligible. A company’s free cash flow is its cash flow
from operations less its capital expenditures, and its enterprise value is its market capitalization plus its debt and less its cash and
cash equivalents. All eligible companies are ranked according to next year’s estimated cash flow yield and the top 75 are selected
for the Index (each, an “Index Component”). To limit turnover in the Index a buffer rule is included: In case a company is
already an Index Component and is ranked within the top 200 the company remains in the Index. Each Index Component is assigned a weight
according to its free float market capitalization weight which is capped at 5%. The Index is adjusted on the Rebalance Day which is 7
days after the Selection Day. “Selection Day” is the last business day in March, June, September, and December. The determination
of the Index Universe and the selection of Index Components is made by the Index Provider based on its proprietary methodology. The Index
Components may change over time.</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify"><b><i>The Fund’s Investment Strategy</i></b></p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">The Fund will invest, under normal circumstances,
at least 80% of its net assets, plus the amount of any borrowings for investment purposes, in in the securities that comprise the Index
(the “80% Policy”). The Index may include securities of large- and mid-capitalization companies. The Fund's 80% Policy is
non-fundamental and requires 60 days prior written notice to shareholders before it can be changed.</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">The Fund uses a “passive” or indexing
approach to try to achieve the Fund’s investment objective. Unlike many investment companies, the Fund does not try to beat the
Index and does not seek temporary defensive positions when markets decline or appear overvalued. Indexing may eliminate the chance that
the Fund will substantially outperform the Index but also may reduce some of the risks of active management, such as poor security selection.
Indexing seeks to achieve lower costs and better after-tax performance by aiming to keep portfolio turnover low in comparison to actively
managed investment companies.</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">The Fund will generally use a “replication”
strategy to achieve its investment objective, meaning it will invest in all of the component securities of the Index in the same approximate
proportion as in the Index. However, the Fund may utilize a representative sampling strategy with respect to the Index when a replication
strategy might be detrimental or disadvantageous to shareholders, such as when there are practical difficulties or substantial costs involved
in compiling a portfolio of equity securities to replicate the Index, in instances in which a security in the Index becomes temporarily
illiquid, unavailable or less liquid, or as a result of legal restrictions or limitations (such as tax diversification requirements) that
apply to the Fund but not the Index. The Adviser expects that, over time, the correlation between the Fund’s performance and that
of the Index, before fees and expenses, will be 95% or better. If the Fund uses a replication strategy, it can be expected to have greater
correlation to the Index than if it uses a representative sampling strategy.</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">The Fund is considered to be non-diversified, which
means that it may invest more of its assets in the securities of a single issuer or a smaller number of issuers than if it were a diversified
fund. To the extent the Index is concentrated (i.e., holds 25% or more of its total assets) in a particular industry or group of industries,
the Fund is expected to be concentrated in that industry or group of industries to approximately the same extent that the Index concentrates
in an industry or group of industries. [As of May __, 2023, a significant portion of the Index is represented by securities of companies
in the consumer staples and financials sectors. The degree to which Index Components represent certain sectors or industries may change
over time.]</p>

The Fund is subject to the risks summarized below. Some or all of these risks may adversely affect the Fund’s net asset value per

that may affect the profitability or viability of companies in a particular industry. As a result, the value of the Fund’s investments

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">The Fund will invest, under normal circumstances,
at least 80% of its net assets, plus the amount of any borrowings for investment purposes, in in the securities that comprise the Index
(the “80% Policy”). Index securities include US exchange traded large- and mid-capitalization equity securities that are classified
as Internet Companies by the Index Provider. Internet Companies represent businesses that provide internet-related services, including,
but not limited to, internet software, internet search engines, web hosting, website design or internet retail commerce. The Fund's 80%
Policy is non-fundamental and requires 60 days prior written notice to shareholders before it can be changed.</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">The Fund uses a “passive” or indexing
approach to try to achieve the Fund’s investment objective. Unlike many investment companies, the Fund does not try to beat the
Index and does not seek temporary defensive positions when markets decline or appear overvalued. Indexing may eliminate the chance that
the Fund will substantially outperform the Index but also may reduce some of the risks of active management, such as poor security selection.
Indexing seeks to achieve lower costs and better after-tax performance by aiming to keep portfolio turnover low in comparison to actively
managed investment companies.</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">The Fund will generally use a “replication”
strategy to achieve its investment objective, meaning it will invest in all of the component securities of the Index in the same approximate
proportion as in the Index. However, the Fund may utilize a representative sampling strategy with respect to the Index when a replication
strategy might be detrimental or disadvantageous to shareholders, such as when there are practical difficulties or substantial costs involved
in compiling a portfolio of equity securities to replicate the Index, in instances in which a security in the Index becomes temporarily

means that it may invest more of its assets in the securities of a single issuer or a smaller number of issuers than if it were a diversified

the Fund is expected to be concentrated in that industry or group of industries to approximately the same extent that the Index concentrates
in an industry or group of industries. [As of May __, 2023, a significant portion of the Index is represented by securities of companies
in the internet industry and the communications services and information technology sectors.] The degree to which Index Components represent
certain sectors or industries may change over time.</p>

such event, the Fund’s performance will be particularly susceptible to adverse events impacting such industry or sector, which may
include, but are not limited to, the following: general economic conditions or cyclical market patterns that could negatively affect supply
and demand; competition for resources; adverse labor relations; political or world events; obsolescence of technologies; and increased
competition or new product introductions that may affect the profitability or viability of companies in a particular industry or sector.
As a result, the value of the Fund’s investments may rise and fall more than the value of shares of a fund that invests in securities

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">The Fund employs a “passive management”
(or indexing) investment approach designed to track the performance, before fees and expenses, of the Solactive US R&amp;D Champions Index

Provider”), which is an organization that is independent of, and unaffiliated with, the Fund and Themes Management Company, LLC,

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">Based on the Index Universe, the initial composition
of the Index, as well as any selection for an ordinary rebalance, is determined on the Selection Day by the Index Provider based on its
R&amp;D ranking metric. To be eligible for the Index a company must meet the following criteria: 1) must have increasing research &amp;
development expenses in each of the last three years; 2) must have a positive return on equity in each of the last three years; 3) must
have a positive return on assets in each of the last three years; and 4) must have a positive profit margin in each of the last three
years. All eligible companies are then assigned a ranking based on the Index Provider’s R&amp;D ranking metric. This R&amp;D metric
ranks a company’s research &amp; development activities by determining the percentage that research &amp; development expenses are
of a company’s sales and net income with the top 50 R&amp;D focused companies being selected for the Index. The determination of
the Index Universe and the selection of securities for inclusion in the Index (“Index Components”) is made by the Index Provider

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">The Fund will invest, under normal circumstances,
at least 80% of its net assets, plus the amount of any borrowings for investment purposes, in securities that comprise the Index (the
“80% Policy”). The Index may include securities of large- and mid- capitalization companies. The Fund's 80% Policy is non-fundamental
and requires 60 days prior written notice to shareholders before it can be changed.</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">The Fund uses a “passive” or indexing
approach to try to achieve the Fund’s investment objective. Unlike many investment companies, the Fund does not try to beat the
Index and does not seek temporary defensive positions when markets decline or appear overvalued. Indexing may eliminate the chance that
the Fund will substantially outperform the Index but also may reduce some of the risks of active management, such as poor security selection.
Indexing seeks to achieve lower costs and better after-tax performance by aiming to keep portfolio turnover low in comparison to actively
managed investment companies.</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">The Fund will generally use a “replication”
strategy to achieve its investment objective, meaning it will invest in all of the component securities of the Index in the same approximate
proportion as in the Index. However, the Fund may utilize a representative sampling strategy with respect to the Index when a replication
strategy might be detrimental or disadvantageous to shareholders, such as when there are practical difficulties or substantial costs involved
in compiling a portfolio of equity securities to replicate the Index, in instances in which a security in the Index becomes temporarily
illiquid, unavailable or less liquid, or as a result of legal restrictions or limitations (such as tax diversification requirements) that
apply to the Fund but not the Index. The Adviser expects that, over time, the correlation between the Fund’s performance and that
of the Index, before fees and expenses, will be 95% or better. If the Fund uses a replication strategy, it can be expected to have greater
correlation to the Index than if it uses a representative sampling strategy.</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">The Fund is considered to be non-diversified, which
means that it may invest more of its assets in the securities of a single issuer or a smaller number of issuers than if it were a diversified
fund. To the extent the Index is concentrated (i.e., holds 25% or more of its total assets) in a particular industry or group of industries,
the Fund is expected to be concentrated in that industry or group of industries to approximately the same extent that the Index concentrates
in an industry or group of industries. [As of May __, 2023, a significant portion of the Index is represented by securities of companies
in the information technology sector.] The degree to which components of the Index represent certain sectors or industries may&nbsp;change
over time.&#8195;</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">The Fund employs a “passive management”
(or indexing) investment approach designed to track the performance, before fees and expenses, of the Solactive US Small Cap Cash Flow
Champions Index, or any successor thereto (the “Index”). The Index is based on a proprietary methodology developed and maintained
by Solactive AG (the “Index Provider”), which is an organization that is independent of, and unaffiliated with, the Fund and
Themes Management Company, LLC, the Fund’s investment adviser (the “Adviser”).</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">The Index is a free-float adjusted, market capitalization
weighted index that is designed to provide exposure to small capitalization U.S. companies that have a high cash flow yield. The Index
is denominated in US dollars. [As of May __, 2023, the Index was comprised of __ companies with a market capitalization range of between
approximately $___ million and $__ billion and a weighted average market capitalization of approximately $_ billion.]</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">In constructing or adjusting the Index, the Index
Provider identifies an “Index Universe” of companies that, on Selection Days (as defined below), fulfill the following requirements:
1) is a member of the Solactive GBS (Global Benchmark Series) United States Small Cap Index (which includes the bottom 15% of the total
US market capitalization); and 2) only companies with a positive cash flow yield (free cash flow/enterprise value) in the last 4 years
are eligible. A company’s free cash flow is its cash flow from operations less its capital expenditures, and its enterprise value
is its market capitalization plus its debt and less its cash and cash equivalents. All eligible companies are ranked according to next
year’s estimated cash flow yield and the top 75 are selected for the Index (each, an “Index Component”). To limit turnover
in the Index a buffer rule is included: In case a company is already an Index Component and is ranked within the top 200 the company remains
in the Index. Each Index Component is assigned a weight according to its free float market capitalization weight which is capped at 5%.
The Index is adjusted on the Rebalance Day which is 7 days after the Selection Day. “Selection Day” is the last business day
in March, June, September, and December. The determination of the Index Universe and the selection of Index Components is made by the
Index Provider based on its proprietary methodology. The Index Components may change over time.</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">The Fund will invest, under normal circumstances,
at least 80% of its net assets, plus the amount of any borrowings for investment purposes, in in the securities that comprise the Index
(the “80% Policy”). The Fund's 80% Policy is non-fundamental and requires 60 days prior written notice to shareholders before
it can be changed.</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">The Fund uses a “passive” or indexing
approach to try to achieve the Fund’s investment objective. Unlike many investment companies, the Fund does not try to beat the
Index and does not seek temporary defensive positions when markets decline or appear overvalued. Indexing may eliminate the chance that
the Fund will substantially outperform the Index but also may reduce some of the risks of active management, such as poor security selection.
Indexing seeks to achieve lower costs and better after-tax performance by aiming to keep portfolio turnover low in comparison to actively
managed investment companies.</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">The Fund will generally use a “replication”
strategy to achieve its investment objective, meaning it will invest in all of the component securities of the Index in the same approximate
proportion as in the Index. However, the Fund may utilize a representative sampling strategy with respect to the Index when a replication
strategy might be detrimental or disadvantageous to shareholders, such as when there are practical difficulties or substantial costs involved
in compiling a portfolio of equity securities to replicate the Index, in instances in which a security in the Index becomes temporarily
illiquid, unavailable or less liquid, or as a result of legal restrictions or limitations (such as tax diversification requirements) that
apply to the Fund but not the Index. The Adviser expects that, over time, the correlation between the Fund’s performance and that
of the Index, before fees and expenses, will be 95% or better. If the Fund uses a replication strategy, it can be expected to have greater
correlation to the Index than if it uses a representative sampling strategy.</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">The Fund is considered to be non-diversified, which
means that it may invest more of its assets in the securities of a single issuer or a smaller number of issuers than if it were a diversified
fund. To the extent the Index is concentrated (i.e., holds 25% or more of its total assets) in a particular industry or group of industries,
the Fund is expected to be concentrated in that industry or group of industries to approximately the same extent that the Index concentrates
in an industry or group of industries. [As of May __, 2023, a significant portion of the Index is represented by securities of companies
in the financials sector.] The degree to which Index Components represent certain sectors or industries may change over time.</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">In constructing or adjusting the Index, the Index
Provider identifies an “Index Universe” of companies that, on Selection Day (as defined below), fulfill the following requirements:
1) are a part/component of the STOXX World AC Index (a free float market capitalization-weighted index designed to measure the performance
of large-, mid- and small- capitalization companies, as calculated by the Index Provider, that represent the top 85% of the investable
market capitalization of each developed and emerging market country included in the index); 2) have free-float market capitalization greater
than $100 million; 3) have a three month Average Daily Traded Value (ADTV) greater than $1 million; 4) have more than 50% of revenues
generated within the sectors associated with the wind energy theme as defined by FactSet RBICS (e.g., China Wind Wholesale Power, United
States Wind Wholesale Power, Canada Wind Wholesale Power, Europe Wind Wholesale Power, Latin America Wind Wholesale Power, Middle East
and Africa Solar Wholesale Power, Other Asia/Pacific Wind Wholesale Power, Wind Energy Equipment Manufacturing and Alternative Energy
Infrastructure Construction) (the “Index Components”). The revenue threshold is lowered to 45% for existing Index Components.
The Index aims to have a minimum number of 50 Index Components at each review. If the screening process described above results in being
too restrictive, the revenue filter is progressively lowered in steps of 5% for the Index, to a minimum of 30% (25% for current Index
Components), until the number of constituents is equal to or greater than 50.</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">The Index Components are ranked according to their
free float market capitalization. The Index is then capped so that the maximum Index Component weight is no higher than 8% and Index Components
with a weight over 4.5% do not exceed 35% in aggregation. If a situation arises where capping is infeasible, the Index Components are
equally weighted.</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">The composition of the Index is ordinarily reviewed
once a year in September (“Selection Day”). The Index Component weight factors are calculated quarterly in March, June, September,
and December. They are published on the second Friday of March, June, September, and December, based on the stocks’ closing prices
the preceding Thursday. The determination of the Index Universe and the selection of the Index Components of the Index is made by the
Index Provider based on its proprietary methodology.&nbsp;The Index Components may change over time.</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">The Fund will invest, under normal circumstances,
at least 80% of its net assets, plus the amount of any borrowings for investment purposes, in in the securities that comprise the Index
and in American Depositary Receipts (“ADRs”) and Global Depositary Receipts (“GDRs”) based on the securities in
the Index (the “80% Policy”). Such securities may include those of large-, mid- and small capitalization companies from developed
and emerging market countries. The Fund's 80% Policy is non-fundamental and requires 60 days prior written notice to shareholders before
it can be changed.</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">The Fund uses a “passive” or indexing
approach. Unlike many investment companies, the Fund does not try to beat the Index and does not seek temporary defensive positions when
markets decline or appear overvalued. Indexing may eliminate the chance that the Fund will substantially outperform the Index but also
may reduce some of the risks of active management, such as poor security selection. Indexing seeks to achieve lower costs and better after-tax
performance by aiming to keep portfolio turnover low in comparison to actively managed investment companies.</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">The Fund will generally use a “replication”
strategy to achieve its investment objective, meaning it will invest in all of the component securities of the Index in the same approximate
proportion as in the Index. However, the Fund may utilize a representative sampling strategy with respect to the Index when a replication
strategy might be detrimental or disadvantageous to shareholders, such as when there are practical difficulties or substantial costs involved
in compiling a portfolio of equity securities to replicate the Index, in instances in which a security in the Index becomes temporarily
illiquid, unavailable or less liquid, or as a result of legal restrictions or limitations (such as tax diversification requirements) that
apply to the Fund but not the Index. The Adviser expects that, over time, the correlation between the Fund’s performance and that
of the Index, before fees and expenses, will be 95% or better. If the Fund uses a replication strategy, it can be expected to have greater
correlation to the Index than if it uses a representative sampling strategy.</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">The Fund is considered to be non-diversified, which
means that it may invest more of its assets in the securities of a single issuer or a smaller number of issuers than if it were a diversified
fund. To the extent the Index is concentrated (i.e., holds 25% or more of its total assets) in a particular industry or group of industries,
the Fund is expected to be concentrated in that industry or group of industries to approximately the same extent that the Index concentrates
in an industry or group of industries. [As of May __, 2023, companies in the wind energy distribution and related manufacturing industry
and utilities and energy sectors represented a significant portion of the Index.] The degree to which components of the Index represent
certain sectors or industries may change over time.</p>

The Chinese government strictly regulates the payment of foreign currency denominated obligations and sets monetary policy. The Chinese

Fund may not be able to sell an investment at the price assigned to the investment by the Fund. In addition, the securities in which the

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">The Fund is an ETF. This means that individual Shares
of the Fund may only be purchased and sold in the secondary market through brokers at market prices, rather than NAV. Because Shares trade
at market prices rather than NAV, Shares may trade at a price greater than NAV (premium) or less than NAV (discount).</p>

only in large blocks of shares known as “Creation Units,” which only institutions or large investors may purchase or redeem.
The Fund generally issues and redeems Creation Units in exchange for a portfolio of securities (the “Deposit Securities”)
and/or a designated amount of U.S. cash that the Fund specifies each day.</p>

between the highest price a buyer is willing to pay to purchase Shares (bid) and the lowest price a seller is willing to accept for Shares
(ask) when buying or selling Shares in the secondary market (the “bid-ask spread”). Recent information about the Fund, including
its net asset value, market price, premiums and discounts, and bid-ask spreads is available on the Fund’s website at www.ThemesETFs.com.</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0 0 0 31.5pt; text-align: justify"><i>Agricultural Production Industry Risk.</i>
Companies engaged in agricultural production may be adversely affected by changes or trends in commodity prices and labor costs, which
may be influenced by unpredictable factors. Many companies in the agricultural production industry are subject to government subsidy policies
and environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. Any changes to these policies and regulations, or the imposition of tariffs
or other trade restraints, may have a material adverse effect on companies operating in this industry. Adverse weather conditions (such
as floods or droughts), natural disasters and other factors, such as disease outbreaks, war or other conflict, also may adversely affect
companies operating in this industry.</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0 0 0 31.5pt; text-align: justify"><i>Airline Industry Risk.</i> Airline Companies
may be adversely affected by a downturn in economic conditions that can result in decreased demand for air travel. Due to the discretionary
nature of business and leisure travel spending, airline industry revenues are heavily influenced by the condition of the U.S. economy
and economies in other regions of the world. Airline Companies may also be significantly affected by changes in fuel prices, which may
be very volatile. Due to the competitive nature of the airline industry, Airline Companies may not be able to pass on increased fuel prices
to customers by increasing fares. Airline Companies may also be significantly affected by the imposition of tariffs and/or changes in
labor relations, insurance costs, and the imposition by the United States or other countries of taxes or tariffs applicable to airline
travel, aircraft manufacturing, or aircraft sales. The trend in the United States has been to deregulate transportation companies, which
could have a favorable long-term effect, but future government decisions could adversely affect Airline Companies. Airline Companies may
also be highly dependent on aircraft or related equipment from a small number of suppliers, and consequently, issues affecting the availability,
reliability, safety, or longevity of such aircraft or equipment (e.g., the inability of a supplier to meet aircraft demand or the grounding
of an aircraft due to safety concerns) may have a significant effect on the operations and profitability of Airline Companies.</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0 0 0 31.5pt; text-align: justify">Airline Companies operating airline-related
internet media and services face intense competition, which may have an adverse effect on profit margins. Such companies may have limited
product lines, markets, financial resources, or personnel, and their products may face obsolescence due to rapid technological developments
and frequent new product introduction. Such companies may face unpredictable changes in growth rates, competition for the services of
qualified personnel, and competition from foreign competitors with lower production costs. Companies operating websites and other media
may be heavily dependent on patent and intellectual property rights, the loss or impairment of which may adversely affect the profitability
of these companies.</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0 0 0 31.5pt; text-align: justify">Beginning in the first quarter of 2020,
financial markets in the United States and around the world experienced extreme and in many cases unprecedented volatility and severe
losses due to the global pandemic caused by COVID-19, a novel coronavirus. The pandemic has resulted in a wide range of social and economic
disruptions, including closed borders and reduced or prohibited domestic or international travel. Some sectors of the economy and individual
issuers, including Airline Companies, have experienced particularly large losses. Travel restrictions imposed in the United States and
other countries have resulted in Airline Companies seeing dramatically reduced passenger demand and, consequently, reducing flight schedules
at unprecedented rates. In particular, certain U.S. passenger airlines have eliminated nearly all international flights for an undetermined
length of time. The U.S. airline industry requested and received financial assistance from the U.S. government due to the impact of the
pandemic; however, there can be no guarantee as to whether such assistance will be successful in supporting U.S. Airline Companies until
the impact of the pandemic subsides.</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0 0 0 31.5pt; text-align: justify">In addition, the Russian invasion of Ukraine
and the resulting Russian sanctions by Western countries, including the United States, Canada, European Union, Japan, United Kingdom,
and others, as well as retaliatory measures by Russia, may have a significant impact on Airline Companies. Bans on oil and energy imports
from Russia, as well as commitments to phase out such imports in the near future, by certain Western countries may increase the costs
of jet fuel. In addition, certain Western nations have closed their airspace to all Russian airlines, as well as Russian-owned and Russian-operated
aircraft. Also, Western companies have issued a recall of aircraft leased to Russian airlines and, in certain cases, have seized such
aircraft located in Western airports. In response, Russia has closed its airspace to certain Western aircraft, and Russia has seized certain
leased aircraft and equipment located in Russia. These actions may lead to higher ticket prices, flight cancellations, longer routes,
fewer diversion airports (i.e., airports along a route where a plane can land safely if it is diverted), a decreased demand for travel,
and the permanent loss of property for Western companies that leased aircraft to Russian airlines. Increased costs and reduced supply
of certain metals exported from Russia, such as titanium, may also slow the production of aircraft and engines, making it more difficult
for Airline Companies to increase passenger capacity and repair or upgrade their aircraft. These and any related events could significantly
and adversely affect the Fund’s performance and the value of an investment in the Fund.</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0 0 0 31.7pt; text-align: justify"><i>Banking Industry Risk. </i>Companies
in the banking sector of an economy are subject to extensive governmental regulation and intervention, which may adversely affect the
scope of their activities, the prices they can charge, the amount of capital they must maintain and, potentially, their size. The extent
to which the Fund may invest in a company that engages in securities-related activities or banking is limited by applicable law. Extensive
governmental regulation may limit the amounts and types of loans and other financial commitments companies in the banking sector can make,
the interest rates and fees they can charge, the scope of their activities, the prices they can charge and the amount of capital they
must maintain. Such governmental regulation may change frequently and may have significant adverse consequences for companies in the banking
sector, including effects not intended by such regulation. Recently enacted legislation in the U.S. has relaxed capital requirements and
other regulatory burdens on certain U.S. banks. While the effect of the legislation may benefit certain companies in the financials sector,
increased risk taking by affected banks may also result in greater overall risk in the U.S. and global financials sector. The impact of
changes in capital requirements, or recent or future regulation in various countries, on any individual financial company or on the financials
sector as a whole cannot be predicted. Certain risks may impact the value of investments in the financials sector more severely than those
of investments outside this sector, including the risks associated with companies that operate with substantial financial leverage. Banking
companies may also be adversely affected by increases in interest rates and loan losses, decreases in the availability of money or asset
valuations, credit rating downgrades and adverse conditions in other related markets. Their profitability is heavily dependent on the
availability and cost of capital funds and can fluctuate significantly when interest rates change or due to increased competition. Credit
losses resulting from financial difficulties of borrowers can negatively impact banking companies. The banking sector is particularly
sensitive to fluctuations in interest rates. The banking sector is also a target for cyberattacks, and may experience technology malfunctions
and disruptions. In recent years, cyberattacks and technology malfunctions and failures have become increasingly frequent in this sector
and have reportedly caused losses to companies in this sector, which may negatively impact the Fund.</p>

The Fund will be sensitive to, and its performance will depend to a greater extent on, the overall condition of gold and/or silver mining
companies. Because the Fund invests in stocks and depositary receipts of U.S. and foreign companies that are involved in the gold and/or
silver mining industry, it is subject to certain risks associated with such companies. Investments related to gold and silver are considered
speculative and are affected by a variety of factors. Competitive pressures may have a significant effect on the financial condition of
gold and silver mining companies. Also, gold and silver mining companies are highly dependent on the price of gold or silver bullion but
may also be adversely affected by a variety of worldwide economic, financial and political factors. Therefore, the securities of gold
and silver mining companies may under- or over-perform commodities themselves over the short-term or long-term. Gold and silver bullion
prices may fluctuate substantially over short periods of time, even during periods of rising prices, so the Fund’s Share price may
be more volatile than other types of investments. To the extent the Fund invests in gold and/or silver bullion, such investments may incur
higher storage and custody costs as compared to purchasing, holding and selling more traditional investments.</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0 0 0 31.5pt; text-align: justify">A drop in the price of gold and silver
bullion would particularly adversely affect the profitability of small- and medium- capitalization mining companies and their ability
to secure financing. Mining operations have varying expected life spans, and companies that have mines with short expected life spans
may experience more stock price volatility. Furthermore, companies that are only in the exploration stage are typically unable to adopt
specific strategies for controlling the impact of the price of gold and/or silver. The price of gold and silver may fluctuate. These prices
may fluctuate substantially over short periods of time so the Fund’s Share price may be more volatile than other types of investments.
Fluctuation in the prices of gold and silver may be due to a number of factors, including the changes in inflation, changes in currency
exchange rates and changes in industrial and commercial demand for metals (including fabricator demand). Additionally, increased environmental
or labor costs may depress the value of metal investments.</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0 0 0 31.5pt; text-align: justify">The prices of gold, silver and precious
metals operation companies are affected by the price of gold, silver or other precious metals such as platinum and palladium, as well
as other prevailing market conditions. These prices may be volatile, fluctuating substantially over short periods of time. The prices
of precious metals may also be influenced by macroeconomic conditions, including confidence in the global monetary system and the relative
strength of various currencies, as well as demand in the industrial and jewelry sectors. In times of significant inflation or great economic
uncertainty, gold, silver and other precious metals may outperform traditional investments such as bonds and stocks. However, in times
of stable economic growth, traditional equity and debt investments could offer greater appreciation potential and the value of gold, silver
and other precious metals may be adversely affected, which could in turn affect the Fund’s returns. Gold- and silver- related investments
as a group have not performed as well as the stock market in general during periods when the U.S. dollar is strong, inflation is low and
general economic conditions are stable. Additionally, returns on gold- and silver- related investments have traditionally been more volatile
than investments in broader equity or debt markets. In addition, some gold, silver and precious metals mining companies have hedged, to
varying degrees, their exposure to decreases in the prices of gold, silver or precious metals by selling forward future production, which
could limit the company’s benefit from future rises in the prices of gold, silver or precious metals or increase the risk that the
company could fail to meet its contractual obligations.</p>

in currency exchange rates and the relative value of non-U.S. currencies will affect the value of the Fund’s investments and the
value of your Shares. Because the Fund’s NAV is determined on the basis of U.S. dollars, the U.S. dollar value of your investment
in the Fund may go down if the value of the local currency of the non-U.S. markets in which the Fund invests depreciates against the U.S.
dollar. This is true even if the local currency value of securities in the Fund’s holdings goes up. Conversely, the dollar value
of your investment in the Fund may go up if the value of the local currency appreciates against the U.S. dollar. The value of the U.S.
dollar measured against other currencies is influenced by a variety of factors. These factors include, among others: national debt levels
and trade deficits, changes in balances of payments and trade, domestic and foreign interest and inflation rates, global or regional political,
public health, cyber, economic or financial events, monetary policies of governments, actual or potential government intervention, epidemics,
and global energy prices. Political instability, the possibility of government intervention and restrictive or opaque business and investment
policies may also reduce the value of a country’s currency. Government monetary policies and the buying or selling of currency by
a country’s government may also influence exchange rates. Currency exchange rates can be very volatile and can change quickly and
unpredictably. As a result, the value of an investment in the Fund may change quickly and without warning, and you may lose money.</font></p>

use of technologies such as the internet to conduct business, the Fund, Authorized Participants, service providers and the relevant listing
exchange are susceptible to operational, information security and related “cyber” risks both directly and through their service
providers. Similar types of cybersecurity risks are also present for issuers of securities in which the Fund invests, which could result
in material adverse consequences for such issuers and may cause the Fund’s investment in such issuers to lose value. In general,
cyber incidents can result from deliberate attacks or unintentional events. Cyber incidents include, but are not limited to, gaining unauthorized
access to digital systems (e.g., through “hacking” or malicious software coding) for purposes of misappropriating assets or
sensitive information, corrupting data, or causing operational disruption. Cyberattacks may also be carried out in a manner that does
not require gaining unauthorized access, such as causing denial-of-service attacks on websites (i.e., efforts to make network services
unavailable to intended users). Recently, geopolitical tensions may have increased the scale and sophistication of deliberate attacks,
particularly those from nation-states or from entities with nation-state backing.</p>

of, the systems of the Fund’s investment adviser, distributor and other service providers (including, but not limited to, index
and benchmark providers, fund accountants, custodians, transfer agents and administrators), market makers, Authorized Participants or
the issuers of securities in which the Fund invests have the ability to cause disruptions and impact business operations, potentially
resulting in: financial losses, interference with the Fund’s ability to calculate its NAV, disclosure of confidential trading information,
impediments to trading, submission of erroneous trades or erroneous creation or redemption orders, the inability of the Fund or its service
providers to transact business, violations of applicable privacy and other laws, regulatory fines, penalties, reputational damage, reimbursement
or other compensation costs, or additional compliance costs. In addition, cyberattacks may render records of Fund assets and transactions,
shareholder ownership of Fund shares, and other data integral to the functioning of the Fund inaccessible, inaccurate or incomplete. Substantial
costs may be incurred by the Fund in order to resolve or prevent cyber incidents in the future. While the Fund has established business
continuity plans in the event of, and risk management systems to prevent, such cyber incidents, there are inherent limitations in such
plans and systems, including the possibility that certain risks have not been identified, that prevention and remediation efforts will
not be successful or that cyberattacks will go undetected. Furthermore, the Fund cannot control the cybersecurity plans and systems put
in place by service providers to the Fund, issuers in which the Fund invests, the Index Provider, market makers or Authorized Participants.
The Fund and its shareholders could be negatively impacted as a result.</p>

may invest in depositary receipts (including ADRs and GDRs), which involve similar risks to those associated with investments in foreign
securities. Depositary receipts are receipts listed on U.S. or foreign exchanges issued by banks or trust companies that entitle the holder
to all dividends and capital gains that are paid out on the underlying foreign shares. The issuers of certain depositary receipts are
under no obligation to distribute shareholder communications to the holders of such receipts, or to pass through to them any voting rights
with respect to the deposited securities. Investments in depositary receipts may be less liquid than the underlying shares in their primary
trading market and, if not included in the Index, may negatively affect the Fund’s ability to replicate the performance of its Index.
In addition, investments in depositary receipts that are not included in a Fund’s Index may increase tracking error. The issuers
of depositary receipts may discontinue issuing new depositary receipts and withdraw existing depositary receipts at any time, which may
result in costs and delays in the distribution of the underlying assets to the Fund and may negatively impact the Fund’s performance

in securities and instruments traded in developing or emerging markets, or that provide exposure to such securities or markets, can involve
additional risks relating to political, economic, or regulatory conditions not associated with investments in U.S. securities and instruments.
For example, a Fund that invests in developing and emerging markets may be subject to (i) greater market volatility, (ii) lower trading
volume and liquidity, (iii) greater social, political and economic uncertainty, (iv) governmental controls on foreign investments and
limitations on repatriation of invested capital, (v) lower disclosure, corporate governance, auditing and financial reporting standards,
(vi) fewer protections of property rights, (vii) restrictions on the transfer of securities or currency, and (viii) settlement and trading
practices that differ from those in U.S. markets. Less developed markets are more likely to experience problems with the clearing and
settling of trades and the holding of securities by local banks, agents and depositories. Each of these factors may impact the ability
of the Fund to buy, sell or otherwise transfer securities, adversely affect the trading market and price for Shares and cause the Fund

and/or sanctions, which may also include retaliatory actions of one government against another government, such as seizure of assets.
Capital controls and/or sanctions include the prohibition of, or restrictions on, the ability to transfer currency, securities or other

inferior rights to receive payment from issuers. Common stocks are susceptible to general stock market fluctuations and to volatile increases
and decreases in value as market confidence in and perceptions of their issuers change. These investor perceptions are based on various
and unpredictable factors including, among others: expectations regarding government, economic, monetary and fiscal policies; inflation
and interest rates; economic expansion or contraction; and global or regional political, public health (pandemics, epidemics, or other
similar circumstances in one or more countries or regions), cyber, economic and banking crises.</font></p>

regional or global events such as war, acts of terrorism, spread of infectious diseases or other public health issues, recessions, or
other events could have a significant negative impact on the Fund and its investments. U.S. and international markets have experienced
volatility in recent months and years due to a number of economic, political and global macro factors, including rising inflation, the
war between Russia and Ukraine, and the impact of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) global pandemic. While U.S. and global economies are
recovering from the effects of the pandemic, the recovery is proceeding at slower than expected rates and may last for a prolonged period
of time. Uncertainties regarding interest rates, political events, the Russia-Ukraine war, rising government debt in the U.S., and trade
tensions have also contributed to market volatility. Such events may affect certain geographic regions, countries, sectors and industries
more significantly than others. Such events could adversely affect the prices and liquidity of the Fund’s portfolio securities or
other instruments and could result in disruptions in the trading markets. The trading prices of debt securities and other instruments
may also fluctuate in response to a variety of other factors, and consequently, the Fund’s NAV and market price may also fluctuate

To the extent the Fund’s investment strategy requires it to redeem Shares for cash or to otherwise include cash as part of its redemption

This may cause the Fund to recognize a capital gain that it might not have recognized if it had made a redemption in- kind. As a result,
the Fund may pay out higher annual capital gain distributions than if the in-kind redemption process was used.</p>

by brokers, as determined by that broker. Brokerage commissions are often a fixed amount and may be a significant proportional cost for
investors seeking to buy or sell relatively small amounts of Shares. In addition, secondary market investors will also incur the cost
of the difference between the price at which an investor is willing to buy Shares (the “bid” price) and the price at which
an investor is willing to sell Shares (the “ask” price). This difference in bid and ask prices is often referred to as the
“spread” or “bid/ask spread.” The bid/ask spread varies over time for Shares based on trading volume and market
liquidity, and is generally lower if Shares have more trading volume and market liquidity and higher if Shares have little trading volume
and market liquidity. Further, a relatively small investor base in the Fund, asset swings in the Fund and/or increased market volatility
may cause increased bid/ask spreads. Due to the costs of buying or selling Shares, including bid/ask spreads, frequent trading of Shares
may significantly reduce investment results and an investment in Shares may not be advisable for investors who anticipate regularly making
small investments.</p>

is more than the NAV intra-day (premium) or less than the NAV intra-day (discount) due to supply and demand of Shares or during periods

is limited trading activity for Shares in the secondary market, in which case such premiums or discounts may be significant. Certain securities
held by the Fund may trade on foreign exchanges that are closed when the Fund’s primary listing exchange is open, and the Fund may

In addition, trading in Shares on its applicable Exchange is subject to trading halts caused by extraordinary market volatility pursuant

in foreign securities involve certain risks that may not be present with investments in U.S. securities. For example, a Fund that invests
in foreign securities may be subject to risk of loss due to foreign currency fluctuations or to political or economic instability. There
may be less information publicly available about a foreign issuer than a U.S. issuer. Foreign issuers may be subject to different accounting,
auditing, financial reporting and investor protection standards than U.S. issuers. Investments in foreign securities may be subject to
withholding or other taxes and may be subject to additional trading, settlement, custodial, and operational risks. With respect to certain
countries, there is the possibility of government intervention and expropriation or nationalization of assets. Because legal systems differ,
there is also the possibility that it will be difficult to obtain or enforce legal judgments in certain countries. Since foreign exchanges
may be open on days when the Fund does not price its Shares, the value of foreign securities in the Fund’s portfolio may change
on days when shareholders will not be able to purchase or sell the Fund’s Shares. Conversely, Fund Shares may trade on days when
foreign exchanges are closed. Each of these factors can make investments in the Fund more volatile and potentially less liquid than other
types of investments.</font></p>

Asian economies have experienced rapid growth and industrialization in recent years, but there is no assurance that this growth rate will

Many Asian countries are subject to political risk, including political instability, corruption and regional conflict with neighboring
countries. North Korea and South Korea each have substantial military capabilities, and historical tensions between the two countries
present the risk of war. Escalated tensions involving the two countries and any outbreak of hostilities between the two countries, or
even the threat of an outbreak of hostilities, could have a severe adverse effect on the entire Asian region. Certain Asian countries
have also developed increasingly strained relationships with the U.S., and if these relations were to worsen, they could adversely affect

China, Japan, Singapore and certain European countries. Reduction in spending on Australian products and services, or changes in any of
the economies, may cause an adverse impact on the Australian economy. Additionally, Australia is located in a part of the world that has

Any such event may adversely impact the Australian economy, causing an adverse impact on the value of the Fund.</p>

Political and legal uncertainty, greater government control over the economy, currency fluctuations or blockage, and the risk of nationalization
or expropriation of assets may result in higher potential for losses. Moreover, governmental actions can have a significant effect on
the economic conditions in India, which could adversely affect the value and liquidity of the Fund’s investments. In November 2016,
the Indian government eliminated certain large denomination cash notes as legal tender, causing uncertainty in certain financial markets.
The securities markets in India are comparatively underdeveloped, and stockbrokers and other intermediaries may not perform as well as
their counterparts in the U.S. and other more developed securities markets. The limited liquidity of the Indian securities markets may
also affect the Fund’s ability to acquire or dispose of securities at the price and time that it desires. Global factors and foreign
actions may inhibit the flow of foreign capital on which India is dependent to sustain its growth. In addition, the Reserve Bank of India
(“RBI”) has imposed limits on foreign ownership of Indian securities, which may decrease the liquidity of the Fund’s
portfolio and result in extreme volatility in the prices of Indian securities. These factors, coupled with the lack of extensive accounting,
auditing and financial reporting standards and practices, as compared to the U.S., may increase the Fund’s risk of loss. Further,
certain Indian regulatory approvals, including approvals from the Securities and Exchange Board of India (“SEBI”), the RBI,
the central government and the tax authorities (to the extent that tax benefits need to be utilized), may be required before the Fund
can make investments in the securities of Indian companies. Capital gains from Indian securities may be subject to local taxation.</p>

in Taiwanese issuers may subject the Fund to legal, regulatory, political, currency and economic risks that are specific to Taiwan. Specifically,
Taiwan’s geographic proximity and history of political contention with China have resulted in ongoing tensions between the two countries.
These tensions may materially affect the Taiwanese economy and its securities market. Taiwan’s economy is export-oriented, so it
depends on an open world trade regime and remains vulnerable to fluctuations in the world economy. Rising labor costs and increasing environmental
consciousness have led some labor-intensive industries to relocate to countries with cheaper work forces, and continued labor outsourcing
may adversely affect the Taiwanese economy.</p>

Escalated tensions involving the two nations and the outbreak of hostilities between the two nations, or even the threat of an
outbreak of hostilities, could have a severe adverse effect on the South Korean economy. In addition, South Korea’s economic

The South Korean economy is heavily reliant on trading exports and disruptions or decreases in trade activity could lead to further
declines.</p>

in Israeli issuers involves risks that are specific to Israel including regulatory, political, currency and economic risks. Among other
things, Israel’s economy depends on imports of certain key items, such as crude oil, natural gas, coal, grains, raw materials, and
military equipment. The economy is also dependent upon external trade with other economies, notably the U.S., China, Japan, Canada, the
United Kingdom and EU countries. Any reduction in trade flows may have an adverse impact on the Fund’s investments. The government
of Israel may change the way in which Israeli companies are taxed or may impose taxes on foreign investment. Such actions could have a
negative impact on the overall market for Israeli securities and on the Fund. Israel’s relations with the Palestinian Authority
and certain neighboring countries such as Lebanon, Syria, Iraq and Iran, among others, have at times been strained due to territorial
disputes, historical animosities or security concerns, which may cause uncertainty in the Israeli markets and adversely affect the overall
economy. Terrorist groups, such as Hezbollah, the “Islamic State” and Hamas, operate in close proximity to Israel’s
borders and frequently threaten Israel with attack. The establishment of fundamentalist Islamic regimes or governments that are hostile
to Israel could have serious consequences for the peace and stability of the region, place additional political, economic and military
constraints upon Israel, materially adversely affect the operations of Israeli issuers and limit such issuers’ ability to sell products
abroad. Actual hostilities or the threat of future hostilities may cause significant volatility in the share price of companies based
in or having significant operations in Israel.</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0 0 0 31.5pt; text-align: justify"><i>Risk of Investing in Developed Markets.</i>
Investment in developed country issuers may subject the Fund to regulatory, political, currency, security, and economic risk specific
to developed countries. Developed countries generally tend to rely on services sectors (e.g., the financial services sector) as the primary
means of economic growth. A prolonged slowdown in, among others, services sectors is likely to have a negative impact on economies of
certain developed countries, although economies of individual developed countries can be impacted by slowdowns in other sectors. In the
past, certain developed countries have been targets of terrorism, and some geographic areas in which the Fund invests have experienced
strained international relations due to territorial disputes, historical animosities, defense concerns and other security concerns. These
situations may cause uncertainty in the financial markets in these countries or geographic areas and may adversely affect the performance
of the issuers to which the Fund has exposure. Heavy regulation of certain markets, including labor and product markets, may have an adverse
effect on certain issuers. Such regulations may negatively affect economic growth or cause prolonged periods of recession. Many developed
countries are heavily indebted and face rising healthcare and retirement expenses and may be underprepared for global health crises. For
example, the rapid and global spread of a highly contagious novel coronavirus respiratory disease, designated COVID-19, has resulted in
extreme volatility in the financial markets and severe losses; reduced liquidity of many instruments; restrictions on international and,
in some cases, local travel; significant disruptions to business operations (including business closures); strained healthcare systems;
disruptions to supply chains, consumer demand and employee availability; and widespread uncertainty regarding the duration and long-term
effects of this pandemic. In addition, price fluctuations of certain commodities and regulations impacting the import of commodities may
negatively affect developed country economies.</p>

Adverse economic and political events in Europe may cause the Fund’s investments to decline in value. The economies and markets
of European countries are often closely connected and interdependent, and events in one country in Europe can have an adverse impact on
other European countries. The EU requires compliance by member countries with restrictions on inflation rates, deficits, interest rates
and debt levels, as well as fiscal and monetary controls, each of which may significantly affect every country in Europe, including those
countries that are not members of the EU. Changes in imports or exports, changes in governmental or EU regulations on trade, changes in
the exchange rate of the euro (the common currency of certain EU countries), the default or threat of default by an EU member country
on its sovereign debt, including, without limitation, the pending threat of default by Greece, and/or an economic recession in an EU member
country may have a significant adverse effect on the economies of EU member countries and their trading partners.</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0 0 0 31.7pt; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in">The European financial
markets have experienced volatility and adverse trends in recent years due to concerns about economic downturns or rising government debt
levels in several European countries, including Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, France, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal, Spain and Ukraine.
These events have adversely affected the exchange rate of the euro and may continue to significantly affect other European countries.
Responses to the financial problems by European governments, central banks and others, including austerity measures and reforms, may not
produce the desired results, may result in social unrest and may limit future growth and economic recovery or have other unintended consequences.
Further defaults or restructurings by governments and other entities of their debt could have additional adverse effects on economies,
financial markets and asset valuations around the world. In addition, one or more countries may abandon the euro and/or withdraw from
the EU. The impact of these actions, especially if they occur in a disorderly fashion, is not clear but could be significant and far-
reaching. The occurrence of terrorist incidents throughout Europe also could impact financial markets. The impact of these events is not
clear but could be significant and far-reaching and adversely affect the value of the Fund. The Fund’s investments could be negatively
impacted by any economic or political instability in any European country.</p>

A decrease in imports or exports, changes in trade regulations or an economic recession in any North American country can have a significant
economic effect on the entire North American region and on some or all of the North American countries to which the Fund has economic
exposure. The U.S. is Canada's and Mexico's largest trading and investment partner. The Canadian and Mexican economies are significantly
affected by developments in the U.S. economy. Since the implementation of the North American Free Trade Agreement (“NAFTA”)
in 1994 among Canada, the U.S. and Mexico, total merchandise trade among the three countries has increased. However, political developments
in the U.S., including the renegotiation of NAFTA and imposition of tariffs by the U.S., may have implications for the trade arrangements
among the U.S., Mexico and Canada, which could negatively affect the value of securities held by the Fund. Policy and legislative changes
in any of the three countries may have a significant effect on North American economies generally, as well as on the value of certain
securities held by the Fund.</p>

in Brazilian issuers involves risks that are specific to Brazil, including legal, regulatory, political, currency and economic risks.
Specifically, Brazilian issuers are subject to possible regulatory and economic interventions by the Brazilian government, including the
imposition of wage and price controls and the limitation of imports. The economy of Brazil has historically been negatively affected by
corruption scandals involving private companies and government officials, which have led to sanctions against firms. In addition, the
market for Brazilian securities is directly influenced by the flow of international capital and economic and market conditions of certain
countries, especially other emerging market countries in Central and South America. The Brazilian economy has historically been exposed
to high rates of inflation and a high level of debt, each of which may reduce and/or prevent economic growth. A rising unemployment rate
could also have the same effect.</p>

Risk. </i>The Chinese government is authoritarian, and has periodically used force to suppress civil dissent. Disparities of wealth and
the pace of economic liberalization may lead to social turmoil, violence and labor unrest. In addition, China continues to experience
disagreements related to integration with Hong Kong and religious and nationalist disputes in Tibet and elsewhere. There is also a greater
risk involved in currency fluctuations, currency convertibility, interest rate fluctuations and higher rates of inflation as a result
of internal social unrest and conflicts with other countries. Unanticipated political or social developments may result in sudden and
significant investment losses. China’s growing income inequality and worsening environmental conditions are also factors that may
affect the Chinese economy. China is alleged to have participated in state-sponsored cyberattacks against foreign companies and foreign
governments. Actual and threatened responses to such activity and strained international relations, including purchasing restrictions,
sanctions, tariffs or cyberattacks on the Chinese government or Chinese companies, may impact China’s economy and Chinese issuers

will continue or that they will be effective. Despite recent reform and privatizations, significant regulation of investment and industry
is still pervasive, and the Chinese government may restrict foreign ownership of Chinese corporations and repatriation of assets without
warning. Chinese markets generally continue to experience inefficiency, volatility and pricing anomalies that may be connected to governmental
influence, a lack of publicly-available information, and political and social instability.</p>

Chinese economy has grown rapidly during the past several years, and there is no assurance that this growth rate will be maintained or
that the economy will not experience recession. In fact, the Chinese economy may experience a significant slowdown as a result of, among
other things, deterioration in global demand for Chinese exports, as well as contraction in spending on domestic goods by the Chinese
consumer. In addition, China may experience substantial rates of inflation or economic recessions, causing a negative effect on the economy
and securities market. Slow development of well-functioning financial markets and widespread corruption have also hindered performance
of the Chinese economy. China continues to receive substantial pressure from trading partners to liberalize official currency exchange
rates and better protect intellectual property rights.</p>

has control. An investment in the Fund involves a risk of a total loss. Moreover, the Chinese government limits foreign investment in
the securities of Chinese issuers entirely. These restrictions or limitations may have adverse effects on the liquidity and performance
of the Fund holdings as compared to the performance of the Index. This may increase the risk of tracking error and the Fund may not be
able to achieve its investment objective.</p>

The government of China has historically maintained strict currency controls in order to achieve economic, trade and political objectives
and regularly intervened in the currency market. In this regard, the Chinese government has placed strict regulation on the yuan and Hong
Kong dollar and manages the yuan and Hong Kong dollar so that they have historically traded in a tight range relative to the U.S. dollar.
The Chinese government has been under pressure to manage the currency in a less restrictive fashion so that it is less correlated to the
U.S. dollar.</p>

rate of the RMB is no longer strictly pegged to the U.S. dollar. The RMB has now moved to a managed floating exchange rate based on market
supply and demand with reference to a basket of foreign currencies. The daily trading price of the RMB against other major currencies
in the inter-bank foreign exchange market is allowed to float within a narrow band around the central parity published by the People’s
Bank of China. As the exchange rates may be based on market forces, the exchange rates for RMB against other currencies, including the
U.S. dollar, are susceptible to movements based on external factors. Of course, there can be no guarantee that this will continue, or
that the yuan or the Hong Kong dollar will move in relation to the U.S. dollar as expected. There can be no assurance that the RMB will
not be subject to devaluation. Any devaluation of the RMB is expected to adversely affect the value of the Fund’s investments.</p>

A-Shares or H-Shares, respectively, or converting RMB or Hong Kong dollars (as applicable) to U.S. dollars to pay cash redemptions, distributions
or expenses. This may lower the Fund’s performance, because any delay could result in the Fund missing an investment opportunity,
purchasing securities at a higher price than originally intended or incurring cash drag.</p>

a high degree of autonomy with regard to its political, legal and economic systems for a period of at least 50 years. China controls matters
that relate to defense and foreign affairs. Under the agreement, China does not tax Hong Kong, does not limit the exchange of the Hong
Kong dollar for foreign currencies and does not place restrictions on free trade in Hong Kong. However, there is no guarantee that China
will continue to honor the agreement and China may change its policies regarding Hong Kong at any time. Any such change may adversely
affect market conditions and the performance of Chinese and Hong Kong issuers and, thus, the value of securities in the Fund’s portfolio.
The economy of Hong Kong has few natural resources and any fluctuation or shortage in the commodity markets could have a significant adverse
effect on the Hong Kong economy. Hong Kong is also heavily dependent on international trade and finance. Additionally, the continuation
and success of the current political, economic, legal and social policies of Hong Kong is dependent on and subject to the control of the

About Chinese Companies. </i>Disclosure and regulatory standards in China are in many respects less stringent than U.S. standards. Chinese
issuers are required to follow PRC accounting standards and practices, which follow international accounting standards to a certain extent.
However, the accounting, auditing and financial reporting standards and practices applicable to PRC companies may be less rigorous, and
there may be significant differences between financial statements prepared in accordance with the PRC accounting standards and practices
and those prepared in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”). In particular, the assets and
profits appearing on the financial statements of a Chinese issuer may not reflect its financial position or results of operations in the
way they would be reflected had such financial statements been prepared in accordance with GAAP. As the disclosure and regulatory standards
in the PRC are less stringent than in more developed markets, there might be substantially less publicly available information about issuers
in the PRC on which the Adviser can base investment decisions, and such information may not be as reliable as information prepared in
accordance with GAAP. Additionally, there is substantially less publicly available information about Chinese issuers than there is about
U.S. issuers. Therefore, disclosure of certain material information may not be made, and less information may be available to the Fund
and other investors than would be the case if the Fund’s investments were restricted to securities of U.S. issuers. Such conditions
may lead to potential errors in index data, index computation and/or index construction and may limit the ability to oversee the index

or impossible, for the Fund to enforce its rights as an investor under Chinese corporate and securities laws, and it may be difficult
or impossible for the Fund to obtain or enforce a judgment in court. Moreover, as Chinese corporate and securities laws continue to develop;
these developments may adversely affect foreign investors such as the Fund.</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0 0 0 31.7pt; text-align: justify"><i>Special Risk Considerations of Investing
in China.</i> For purposes of raising capital offshore on exchanges outside of China, including on U.S. exchanges, many Chinese-based
operating companies are structured as Variable Interest Entities (“VIEs”). In this structure, the Chinese-based operating
company is the VIE and establishes an entity, which is typically offshore in a foreign jurisdiction, such as the Cayman Islands. The offshore
entity lists on a foreign exchange and enters into contractual arrangements with the VIE. This structure allows Chinese companies in which
the government restricts foreign ownership to raise capital from foreign investors. While the offshore entity has no equity ownership
of the VIE, these contractual arrangements permit the offshore entity to consolidate the VIE’s financial statements with its own
for accounting purposes and provide for economic exposure to the performance of the underlying Chinese operating company. Therefore, an
investor in the listed offshore entity, such as the Fund, will have exposure to the Chinese-based operating company only through contractual
arrangements and has no ownership in the Chinese-based operating company. Furthermore, because the offshore entity only has specific rights
provided for in these service agreements with the VIE, its abilities to control the activities at the Chinese-based operating company
are limited and the operating company may engage in activities that negatively impact investment value.</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0 0 0 31.7pt; text-align: justify">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0 0 0 31.7pt; text-align: justify">While the VIE structure has been widely
adopted, it is not formally recognized under Chinese law and therefore there is a risk that the Chinese government could prohibit the
existence of such structures or negatively impact the VIE’s contractual arrangements with the listed offshore entity by making them
invalid. If these contracts were found to be unenforceable under Chinese law, investors in the listed offshore entity, such as the Fund,
may suffer significant losses with little or no recourse available. If the Chinese government determines that the agreements establishing
the VIE structures do not comply with Chinese law and regulations, including those related to restrictions on foreign ownership, it could
subject a Chinese-based issuer to penalties, revocation of business and operating licenses, or forfeiture of ownership interest. In addition,
the listed offshore entity’s control over a VIE may also be jeopardized if a natural person who holds the equity interest in the
VIE breaches the terms of the agreement, is subject to legal proceedings or if any physical instruments for authenticating documentation,
such as chops and seals, are used without the Chinese-based issuer’s authorization to enter into contractual arrangements in China.
Chops and seals, which are carved stamps used to sign documents, represent a legally binding commitment by the company. Moreover, any
future regulatory action may prohibit the ability of the offshore entity to receive the economic benefits of the Chinese-based operating
company, which may cause the value of the Fund’s investment in the listed offshore entity to suffer a significant loss. For example,
in 2021, the Chinese government prohibited use of the VIE structure for investment in after-school tutoring companies. There is no guarantee
that the government will not place similar restrictions on other industries.</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0 0 0 31.7pt; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in"><i>Tax Risk. </i>In order
to qualify for the favorable tax treatment generally available to regulated investment companies, a Fund must satisfy certain income,
distribution and asset diversification requirements. With respect to the latter, a Fund generally may not acquire a security if, as a
result of the acquisition, more than 50% of the value of the Fund’s assets would be invested in (a) issuers in which the Fund has,
in each case, invested more than 5% of the Fund’s assets and (b) issuers more than 10% of whose outstanding voting securities are
owned by the Fund. If the Fund were to fail to qualify as a regulated investment company, it would be taxed in the same manner as an ordinary
corporation, and distributions to its shareholders would not be deductible by the Fund in computing its taxable income, which would adversely
affect its performance. Because there is limited transparency into state ownership of Chinese issuers, there is a risk of such issuers
being deemed to be a single issuer, which could result in the Fund falling out of compliance with the asset diversification requirements.</p>

categorized into “CNY” (onshore RMB) traded in the PRC and “CNH” (offshore RMB) traded outside the PRC. CNY and
CNH are traded at different exchange rates and their exchange rates may not move in the same direction. Although there has been a growing

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0 0 0 0.5in; text-align: justify">CNY is currently not a freely convertible

The PRC government imposes restrictions on the remittance of RMB out of and into China. In the event a remittance by the Fund is disrupted,
the Fund could be adversely affected and, among other matters, may not be able to invest those funds, which may increase the tracking
error of the Fund. In addition, any delay in repatriation of RMB out of China may result in delay in payment of redemption proceeds to
redeeming investors. The Chinese government’s policies on exchange control and repatriation restrictions are subject to change,
and such control of currency conversions and movements in the RMB exchange rates may adversely affect the operations and financial results
of PRC companies and the Fund. If such control policies change in the future, the Fund may be adversely affected.</p>

ability to transfer currency, securities or other assets into, out of or into the country. Levies may be placed on profits repatriated
by foreign entities (such as the Fund). Capital controls may impact the ability of the Fund to buy, sell or otherwise transfer securities

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0 0 0 0.5in; text-align: justify">The Chinese government also heavily regulates
the domestic exchange of foreign currencies within China. Chinese law requires that all domestic transactions must be settled in RMB,
places significant restrictions on the remittance of foreign currency and strictly regulates currency exchange from RMB. Under State Administration
of Foreign Exchange (“SAFE”) regulations, Chinese corporations may only purchase foreign currencies through government approved
banks. In general, Chinese companies must receive approval from or register with the Chinese government before investing in certain capital
account items, including direct investments and loans, and must thereafter maintain separate foreign exchange accounts for the capital
items. Foreign investors may only exchange foreign currencies at specially authorized banks after complying with documentation requirements.
These restrictions may adversely affect the Fund and its investments. The PRC government may impose additional or other currency capital
controls that could significantly harm the Fund.</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0 0 0 0.5in; text-align: justify">The Fund is required by Chinese regulation
to have a local custodian in China (“PRC Custodian”) for its investments in domestic, onshore Chinese securities, including
A-Shares. The PRC Custodian maintains the Fund’s investments in China to ensure their compliance with the rules and regulations
of the China Securities Regulatory Commission (“CSRC”) and the People’s Bank of China. Such investments, when purchased
by the Adviser in its capacity as the Fund’s RQFII or QFII, as applicable, will normally be received in a securities account maintained
by the PRC Custodian in the joint names of the Fund and the Adviser. The account may not be used for any other purpose than for maintaining
the Fund’s assets. However, given that the securities trading account will be maintained in the joint names of the Adviser and the
Fund, the Fund’s assets may not be as well protected, as they would be if it were possible for them to be registered and held solely
in the name of the Fund. In particular, there is a risk that creditors of the Adviser may assert that the securities are owned by the
Adviser and not the Fund, and that a court would uphold such an assertion, in which case such creditors could seize assets. Because the
Fund’s PRC securities quota may be in the name of both the Adviser and the Fund, there is also a risk that regulatory actions taken
against the Adviser by PRC government authorities may affect the Fund. This is particularly acute in the case of cash deposited with the
PRC Custodian because it may not be segregated, and it may be treated as a debt owing from the PRC Custodian to the Fund as a depositor.
Thus, in the event of a PRC Custodian bankruptcy, liquidation, or similar event, the Fund may face difficulties and/or encounter delays
in recovering its cash.</p>

sub-custodian account within such time period as specified by SAFE (up to six months). Following this, investment capital will be subject
to an initial lock-up period (currently three months if the Fund is deemed to be an “open end fund” under Chinese regulations),
during which the assets may not be repatriated to the United States, even if they are never invested. Following that time, investment
principal and earnings may generally only be repatriated with the approval of SAFE, although up to $50 million may be repatriated each
week without SAFE approval if the Fund is deemed to be an “open end fund” under Chinese regulations.</p>

Kong Stock Connect, Shenzhen-Hong Kong Stock Connect, Shanghai-London Stock Connect, and China-Japan Stock Connect, and/or through a QFII

in mainland China, the Shanghai and Shenzhen Stock Exchanges. The Shanghai and Shenzhen Stock Exchanges are supervised by the CSRC and
are highly automated with trading and settlement executed electronically. The Shanghai and Shenzhen Stock Exchanges are substantially
smaller, less liquid and more volatile than the securities markets in the United States.</p>

on December 19, 1990, and the Shenzhen Stock Exchange commenced trading on July 3, 1991. The Shanghai and Shenzhen Stock Exchanges divide
listed shares into two classes: A-Shares and B-shares. Companies whose shares are traded on the Shanghai and Shenzhen Stock Exchanges
that are incorporated in mainland China may issue both A-Shares and B-Shares. In China, the A-Shares and B-Shares of an issuer may only
trade on one exchange. A-Shares and B-Shares may both be listed on either the Shanghai or Shenzhen Stock Exchanges. Both classes represent
an ownership interest comparable to a share of common stock. A-Shares are traded on the Shanghai and Shenzhen Stock Exchanges in RMB.
A-Shares may be subject to more frequent and/or extended trading halts than other exchange-traded securities and may become illiquid.
The A-Shares market may behave very differently from other Chinese equity markets, and there may be little to no correlation between them.</p>

to exist on investments in A-Shares and capital therefore cannot flow freely into the A-Share market, making it possible that, in the
event of a market disruption, the liquidity of the A-Share market and trading prices of A-Shares could be more severely affected than
the liquidity and trading prices of markets where securities are freely tradable and capital therefore flows more freely. The Fund cannot
predict the nature or duration of such a market disruption or the impact that it may have on the A-Share market and the short-term and
long-term prospects of its investments in the A-Share market.</p>

will not change or that repatriation restrictions will not be imposed in the future. Any restrictions on repatriation of the Fund’s
assets may adversely affect the Fund’s ability to meet redemption requests and/or may cause the Fund to borrow money in order to
meet its obligations. These limitations may also prevent a Fund from making certain distributions to shareholders.</p>

exposure to the components of its Index, the Fund could seek exposure to the component securities of the Index in other ways, such as
by investing in depositary receipts of the component securities and Hong Kong listed versions of the component securities. The Fund may
also invest in B-Shares issued by the same companies that issue A-Shares that are in the Index. The A-Shares market may behave very differently
from the B-Shares market, and there may be little to no correlation between the performances of the two. The Fund may also use derivatives
or invest in ETFs that can obtain comparable exposures. If necessary, the Fund may limit or suspend purchases of Creation Units of the
Fund until the Fund determines that the requisite exposure to the Index is obtainable. During the period that creations are limited or
suspended, the Fund could trade at a significant premium or discount to the NAV and could experience substantial redemptions. Alternatively,
the Fund could change its investment objective by, for example, seeking to track an alternative index that does not include A-Shares as
component securities, or decide to liquidate the Fund. In circumstances beyond the control of the Fund, the Fund may incur significant
losses due to limited investment capabilities, including based on investment objectives or strategies, due to investment restrictions
on RQFIIs and QFIIs licenses, illiquidity of the securities markets, or delay or disruption in execution or settlement of trades.</p>

These restrictions or limitations may have adverse effects on the liquidity and performance of the Fund holdings as compared to the performance

Shanghai Stock Exchange through the Shanghai-Hong Kong Stock Connect as of November 17, 2014, and the Shenzhen Stock Exchange through
the Shenzhen-Hong Kong Stock Connect as of December 5, 2016. There is no indication as to how long the temporary exemption will remain
in effect. Accordingly, the Fund may be subject to such taxes in the future. In addition, there is uncertainty as to the application and
implementation of China’s value added tax to the Fund’s activities. As a result, investors may be advantaged or disadvantaged
depending on the final rules of the relevant tax authorities.</p>

may be excessive or inadequate to meet actual CGT tax liabilities (which could include interest and penalties) on the Fund’s investments.
As a result, investors may be advantaged or disadvantaged depending on the final rules of the relevant tax authorities. It is also unclear
how China’s value added tax may apply to the activities of a participant in the Stock Connect Programs or QFII or RQFII licensee
and how such application may be affected by tax treaty provisions. If such a tax is collected, the expense will be passed on and borne
by the Fund. The imposition of such taxes, as well as future changes in applicable PRC tax law, may adversely affect the Fund.</p>

right to establish a reserve for any taxes as to which it is uncertain whether they will be assessed, although it has not currently done
so. If the Fund establishes such a reserve but is not ultimately subject to the tax, shareholders who redeemed or sold their shares while
the reserve was in place will effectively bear the tax and may not benefit from the later release, if any, of the reserve. Conversely,
if the Fund does not establish such a reserve but ultimately is subject to the tax, shareholders who redeemed or sold their shares prior
to the tax being withheld, reserved or paid will have effectively avoided the tax, even if they benefited from the trading that precipitated
the Fund’s payment of it. The Fund is responsible for any taxes on its operations or investments, including if they are applied
retroactively.</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0 0 0 31.7pt; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in"><i>Disclosure of Interests
and Short Swing Profit Rule. </i>The Fund may be subject to regulations promulgated by the CSRC which currently require the Fund to make
certain public disclosures, when the Fund and parties acting in concert with the Fund acquire 5% or more of the issued securities of a
listed company (which include A-Shares of the listed company). The relevant PRC regulations presumptively treat all affiliated investors
and investors under common control as parties acting in concert. As such, the Fund may be deemed as a “concerted party” of
other funds managed by the Adviser and therefore may be subject to the risk that the Fund’s holdings may be required to be reported
in the aggregate with the holdings of such other funds, should the aggregate holdings trigger the reporting threshold under the PRC law.
If the 5% shareholding threshold is triggered, the Fund would be required to file its report within three days. During the time limit
for filing the report, a trading freeze applies, and the Fund would not be permitted to make subsequent trades in the invested company’s
securities. Any such trading freeze may impair the ability of the Fund to track its Index, and may have a negative impact on the Fund’s
performance. Further, subject to the interpretation of PRC courts and PRC regulators, the operation of the short swing profit rule may
prevent the Fund from reducing its holdings in a company, 5% or more of whose shares are deemed to be held by the Fund and its affiliates,
within six months of the last purchase of shares of the company. The Fund could be subject to these restrictions; even though an entity
deemed to be an affiliate (and not the Fund) may have triggered the restrictions. Nonetheless, if the Fund violates the rule, it may be
required by the listed company to return any profits realized from such trading to the company. In addition, the Fund could not repurchase
securities of the listed company within six months of such sale. Finally, under PRC civil procedures, the Fund’s assets may be frozen
to the extent of the claims made by the company in question.</p>

only a limited number of brokers are available to trade A-Shares with the Fund. As a result, the Adviser may have less flexibility to
choose among brokers on behalf of the Fund than is typically the case for U.S. investment managers. This may cause the Fund to incur higher
brokerage expenses and achieve less favorable execution, which could have a negative impact on Fund returns. In addition, in the event
of any default of a PRC broker in the execution or settlement of any transaction or in the transfer of any funds or securities in the
PRC, the Fund may encounter delays in recovering its assets, or may not be able to recover its assets, which could cause the Fund to lose
money. Further, the operation of the Fund may be adversely affected in case of any acts or omissions of a PRC broker, which may result
in, among other things, losses to the Fund and higher tracking error. There is also a risk that the Fund may suffer losses from the default,
bankruptcy or disqualification of a PRC broker. However, the Adviser, in its selection of PRC brokers, will consider such factors as the
competitiveness of PRC brokers’ commission rates, size of the relevant orders, and execution standards.</p>

uncertainty; increased competition from Asia’s low-cost emerging economies; currency exchange rate fluctuations; higher rates of
inflation; controls on foreign investment and limitations on repatriation of invested capital; and greater governmental involvement in

Stock Connect Programs will function properly or will continue to be adapted to changes and developments in both markets. In the event
that the relevant systems do not function properly, trading through the Stock Connect Programs could be disrupted. The Stock Connect Programs

These industries may also be adversely affected by changes in commercial and consumer demand for their products. A growing competitive
landscape and increased availability of such commodities can influence: (i) the planting and raising of certain crops/livestock versus
other uses of resources; (ii) the location and size of crop and livestock production; (iii) whether unprocessed or processed commodity
products are traded; and (iv) the volume and types of imports and exports. Economic recession or labor difficulties may also lead to a
decrease in demand for the products and services involved in agriculture. As a result, the price of agricultural or livestock commodities
could decline, which would affect the performance of the Fund. The agricultural and livestock sectors also are particularly sensitive
to changing weather conditions, such as floods or droughts, natural disasters and other factors, such as disease outbreaks and pollution.</p>

Sector Risk. </i>Communications services companies are subject to extensive government regulation. The costs of complying with governmental
regulations, delays or failure to receive required regulatory approvals, or the enactment of new adverse regulatory requirements may adversely
affect the business of the such companies. Companies in the communications services sector can also be significantly affected by intense
competition, including competition with alternative technologies such as wireless communications (including with 5G and other technologies),
product compatibility, consumer preferences, rapid product obsolescence, and research and development of new products. Technological innovations
may make the products and services of such companies obsolete.</p>

The success of consumer product manufacturers and retailers is tied closely to the performance of domestic and international economies,
interest rates, exchange rates, competition, consumer confidence, changes in demographics and consumer preferences. Companies in the consumer
discretionary sector depend heavily on disposable household income and consumer spending, and may be strongly affected by social trends
and marketing campaigns. These companies may be subject to severe competition, which may have an adverse impact on their profitability.</p>

may also be adversely affected by changes or trends in commodity prices, which may be influenced by unpredictable factors. These companies
may be subject to severe competition, which may have an adverse impact on their profitability. Fads, marketing campaigns, and other factors

</i>The profitability of companies in the energy sector is related to worldwide energy prices, exploration, and production spending. Such
companies also are subject to risks of changes in exchange rates, government regulation, world events, depletion of resources and economic
conditions, as well as market, economic and political risks of the countries where energy companies are located or do business. Oil and
gas exploration and production can be significantly affected by natural disasters. Oil exploration and production companies may be adversely
affected by changes in exchange rates, interest rates, government regulation, world events, and economic conditions. Oil exploration and
production companies may be at risk for environmental damage claims.</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0 0 0 31.7pt; text-align: justify">The energy sector is comprised of energy,
energy industrial, energy infrastructure and energy logistics companies, and will therefore be susceptible to adverse economic, environmental,
business, regulatory or other occurrences affecting that sector. The energy sector has historically experienced substantial price volatility.
At times, the performance of these investments may lag the performance of other sectors or the market as a whole. Master Limited Partnerships
(MLPs) and other companies operating in the energy sector are subject to specific risks, including, among others, fluctuations in commodity
prices; reduced consumer demand for commodities such as oil, natural gas or petroleum products; reduced availability of natural gas or
other commodities for transporting, processing, storing or delivering; slowdowns in new construction; extreme weather or other natural
disasters; and threats of attack by terrorists on energy assets. Additionally, energy sector companies are subject to substantial government
regulation and changes in the regulatory environment for energy companies may adversely impact their profitability. MLPs may incur environmental
costs and liabilities due to the nature of their businesses and the substances they handle. Changes in existing laws, regulations or enforcement
policies governing the energy sector could significantly increase the compliance costs of MLPs. Certain MLPs could, from time to time,
be held responsible for implementing remediation measures, the cost of which may not be recoverable from insurance. Over time, depletion
of natural gas reserves and other energy reserves may also affect the profitability of energy companies.</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0 0 0 31.7pt; text-align: justify"><i>Financials Sector Risk.</i> Companies
in the financials sector of an economy are subject to extensive governmental regulation and intervention, which may adversely affect the
scope of their activities, the prices they can charge, the amount of capital they must maintain and, potentially, their size. The extent
to which the Fund may invest in a company that engages in securities-related activities or banking is limited by applicable law. Governmental
regulation may change frequently and may have significant adverse consequences for companies in the financials sector, including effects
not intended by such regulation. Recently enacted legislation in the U.S. has relaxed capital requirements and other regulatory burdens
on certain U.S. banks. While the effect of the legislation may benefit certain companies in the financials sector, increased risk taking
by affected banks may also result in greater overall risk in the U.S. and global financials sector. The impact of changes in capital requirements,
or recent or future regulation in various countries, on any individual financial company or on the financials sector as a whole cannot
be predicted. Certain risks may impact the value of investments in the financials sector more severely than those of investments outside
this sector, including the risks associated with companies that operate with substantial financial leverage. Companies in the financials
sector are exposed directly to the credit risk of their borrowers and counterparties, who may be leveraged to an unknown degree, including
through swaps and other derivatives products. Financial services companies may have significant exposure to the same borrowers and counterparties,
with the result that a borrower’s or counterparty’s inability to meet its obligations to one company may affect other companies
with exposure to the same borrower or counterparty. This interconnectedness of risk may result in significant negative impacts to companies
with direct exposure to the defaulting counterparty as well as adverse cascading effects in the markets and the financials sector generally.
Companies in the financials sector may also be adversely affected by increases in interest rates and loan losses, decreases in the availability
of money or asset valuations, credit rating downgrades and adverse conditions in other related markets. Insurance companies, in particular,
may be subject to severe price competition and/or rate regulation, which may have an adverse impact on their profitability. The financials
sector is particularly sensitive to fluctuations in interest rates. The financials sector is also a target for cyberattacks, and may experience
technology malfunctions and disruptions. In recent years, cyberattacks and technology malfunctions and failures have become increasingly
frequent in this sector and have reportedly caused losses to companies in this sector, which may negatively impact the Fund</p>

exchange rates, commodity prices, import controls, excess capacity, consumer demand, claims for environmental damage or product liability
and general economic conditions, among other factors. As the demand for, or prices of, industrials increase, the value of the Fund’s

advances could have a significant effect on the value of the Fund’s investments. The value of stocks of information technology companies
and companies that rely heavily on technology is particularly vulnerable to rapid changes in technology product cycles, rapid product
obsolescence, government regulation and competition, both domestically and internationally, including competition from foreign competitors
with lower production costs. Stocks of information technology companies and companies that rely heavily on technology, especially those
of smaller, less-seasoned companies, tend to be more volatile than the overall market. Information technology companies are heavily dependent
on patent and intellectual property rights, the loss or impairment of which may adversely affect profitability. Additionally, companies
in the information technology sector may face dramatic and often unpredictable changes in growth rates and competition for the services
of qualified personnel.</p>

in the transportation sector are also affected by severe weather events, mass casualty accidents or environmental catastrophes, acts of
terrorism and other similar events that target or damage transportation infrastructure or vessels, war or risk of war, widespread disruption
of technology systems and increasing equipment and operational costs. Such global or regional events and conditions may adversely affect
the operations, financial condition and liquidity of companies in the transportation sector and cause insurance premiums to increase dramatically
or result in insurance coverage becoming unavailable for certain business lines or assets. Securities of companies in the transportation
sector are generally cyclical and occasionally subject to sharp price movements.</p>

Sector Risk.</i> The risks inherent in the utilities sector include a variety of factors that may adversely affect the business or operations
of utility companies, including: high interest costs associated with capital construction and improvement programs; difficulty in raising
adequate capital on reasonable terms in periods of high inflation and unsettled capital markets; governmental regulation of rates that
the issuer can charge to customers; costs associated with compliance with, and adjusting to changes to, environmental and other regulations;
effects of economic slowdowns and surplus capacity; increased competition from other providers of utilities services; costs associated
with the reduced availability of certain types of fuel, occasionally reduced availability and high costs of natural gas for resale, and
the effects of energy conservation policies. Some utility companies also face risks associated with the effects of a national energy policy
and lengthy delays, and greatly increased costs and other problems, associated with the design, construction, licensing, regulation and
operation of nuclear facilities for electric generation, including, among other considerations: the problems associated with the use of
radioactive materials and the disposal of radioactive wastes; technological innovations that may render existing plants, equipment or
products obsolete; difficulty in obtaining regulatory approval of new technologies; lack of compatibility of telecommunications equipment;
potential impacts of terrorist activities on the utilities industry and its customers; and the impact of natural or man-made disasters.
Utility companies may also be subject to regulation by various governmental authorities and may be affected by the imposition of special
tariffs and changes in tax laws, regulatory policies and accounting standards. Deregulation is subjecting utility companies to greater
competition and may adversely affect profitability. As deregulation allows utilities to diversify outside of their original geographic
regions and their traditional lines of business, utility companies may engage in riskier ventures. There is no assurance that regulatory
authorities will, in the future, grant rate increases, or that such increases will be adequate to permit the payment of dividends on stocks
issued by a utility company. <font style="font-family: Times New Roman, Times, Serif; font-size: 11pt">In addition, </font>utility stock
prices tend not to fluctuate, which reduces the potential for capital gain. Utility stocks are not insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation or protected by the government in any way. A foreseeable risk to investing in utilities is the rising market of renewable
energy. The downside of the rising energy market is that it may threaten the futures of traditional utility companies.</font></p>

<font style="font-weight: normal">The Fund’s investment in securities of small-capitalization companies may be more vulnerable to
adverse issuer, market, political, public health, cyber or economic developments than securities of larger-capitalization companies. The
securities of small- capitalization companies generally trade in lower volumes and are subject to greater and more unpredictable price
changes than larger capitalization stocks or the stock market as a whole. Some small capitalization companies have limited product lines,
markets, and financial and managerial resources and tend to concentrate on fewer geographical markets relative to larger capitalization
companies. There is typically less publicly available information concerning smaller-capitalization companies than for larger, more established
companies. Small-capitalization companies also may be particularly sensitive to changes in interest rates, government regulation, borrowing
costs and earnings.</font></p>

<p style="font: bold 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0 0 0 0pt; text-align: justify">Tax Status Risk. <font style="font-weight: normal">The
Fund intends to pay dividends each taxable year to enable it to continue to satisfy the distribution requirements necessary to qualify
for treatment as a regulated investment company ("RIC"). If the Fund were to distribute to its shareholders less than the minimum
amount required for any year, the Fund would become subject to federal income tax for that year on all of its taxable income and recognized
gains, even those distributed to its shareholders. In addition, under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"),
the Fund may not earn more than 10% of its annual gross income from gains resulting from the sale of commodities and precious metals.
This could make it more difficult for the Fund to pursue its investment strategy and maintain qualification as a RIC. In lieu of potential
disqualification as a RIC, the Fund is permitted to pay a tax for certain failures to satisfy this income requirement, which, in general,
are limited to those due to reasonable cause and not willful neglect.</font></p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0 0 0 12pt; text-align: justify"><font style="font-weight: normal">&nbsp;</font></p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0 0 0 0pt; text-align: justify"><font style="font-weight: normal">In addition,
to qualify for the favorable tax treatment generally available to RICs, the Fund must satisfy certain diversification requirements. In
particular, the Fund generally may not acquire a security if, as a result of the acquisition, more than 50% of the value of the Fund’s
assets would be invested in (a) issuers in which the Fund has, in each case, invested more than 5% of its assets or (b) issuers more than
10% of whose outstanding voting securities are owned by the Fund. While the weighting of the Index is not inconsistent with these rules,
if the Index is concentrated in a relatively small number of securities, it may not always be possible for the Fund to fully implement
a replication strategy or a representative sampling strategy while satisfying these diversification requirements. The Fund’s efforts
to satisfy the diversification requirements may affect the Fund’s execution of its investment strategy and may cause the Fund’s
return to deviate from that of the Index, and the Fund’s efforts to replicate or represent the Index may cause it inadvertently
to fail to satisfy the diversification requirements. If the Fund were to fail to satisfy the diversification requirements, it could incur
penalty taxes and be forced to dispose of certain assets, or it could fail to qualify as a regulated investment company. If the Fund were
to fail to qualify as a regulated investment company, it would be taxed in the same manner as an ordinary corporation, and distributions
to its shareholders would not be deductible by the Fund in computing its taxable income.</font></p>

about the Fund’s portfolio holdings may not always be reliable, which may make it difficult to obtain a current price for the investments
held by the Fund. Independent market quotations for such investments may not be readily available, such as on days during which a security
does not trade or a foreign holiday, and securities may be fair valued or valued by a pricing service at an evaluated price. These valuations
are subjective and different funds may assign different fair values to the same investment. Such valuations also may be different from
what would be produced if the security had been valued using market quotations. As a result, there is a risk that the Fund may not be
able to sell an investment at the price assigned to the investment by the Fund. Additionally, Fund securities that are valued using techniques
other than market quotations, including “fair valued” securities, may be subject to greater fluctuations in their value from
one day to the next. Because securities in which the Fund invests may trade on days when the Fund does not price its shares, the value
of the securities in the Fund’s portfolio may change on days when shareholders will not be able to purchase or sell the Fund’s
shares.</p>

from a Fund, and only APs may tender their Shares for redemption directly to each Fund, at NAV in Creation Units. Once created, Shares

4:00 p.m. Eastern Time (the “NAV Calculation Time”). If the NYSE closes before 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time, as it occasionally
does, the NAV Calculation Time will be the time the NYSE closes. In addition, any U.S. fixed-income assets may be valued as of the announced
closing time of trading in fixed income instruments on any day that the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association announces
an early closing time. Each Fund’s NAV per share is calculated by dividing the Fund’s net assets by the number of Fund Shares
outstanding.</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0 0 0 0pt; text-align: justify"><font style="font-weight: normal">The
Board has adopted procedures and methodologies to fair value Fund investments whose market prices are not “readily available”
or are deemed to be unreliable. For example, such circumstances may arise when: (i) a security has been de-listed or has had its trading
halted or suspended; (ii) a security’s primary pricing source is unable or unwilling to provide a price; (iii) a security’s
primary trading market is closed during regular market hours; or (iv) a security’s value is materially affected by events occurring
after the close of the security’s primary trading market. Generally, when fair valuing an investment, the Adviser or sub-adviser,
as applicable, will take into account all reasonably available information that may be relevant to a particular valuation including, but
not limited to, fundamental analytical data regarding the issuer, information relating to the issuer’s business, recent trades or
offers of the security, general and/or specific market conditions and the specific facts giving rise to the need to fair value the security.
The Adviser makes fair value determinations in good faith and in accordance with the fair value methodologies included in the Board-adopted
valuation procedures. Due to the subjective and variable nature of fair value pricing, there can be no assurance that the Adviser will
be able to obtain the fair value assigned to the investment upon the sale of such investment.</font></p>

Participants include DTC, securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies, clearing corporations, and other institutions that directly

of stock certificates or to have Shares registered in your name, and you are not considered a registered owner of Shares. Therefore, to
exercise any right as an owner of Shares, you must rely upon the procedures of DTC and its participants. These procedures are the same
as those that apply to any securities that you hold in book-entry or “street name” form. Your broker will provide you with

frequency of purchases and redemptions of Fund Shares. In determining not to impose such restrictions, the Board evaluated the risks of
market timing activities by Fund shareholders. Purchases and redemptions by APs, who are the only parties that may purchase or redeem
Shares directly with a Fund, are an essential part of the ETF process and help keep Fund share trading prices in line with NAV. As such,
each Fund accommodates frequent purchases and redemptions by APs. However, the Board has also determined that frequent purchases and redemptions
for cash may increase tracking error and portfolio transaction costs and may lead to the realization of capital gains. To minimize these
potential consequences of frequent purchases and redemptions, each Fund imposes transaction fees on purchases and redemptions of Creation
Units to cover the custodial and other costs incurred by the Fund in effective trades. In addition, each Fund and the Adviser reserve
the right to reject any purchase order at any time.</p>

failure to qualify as a RIC or to meet minimum distribution requirements would result (if certain relief provisions were not available)

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0 0 0 0pt; text-align: justify">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0 0 0 0pt; text-align: justify">Tax reform legislation commonly known as
the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”) was enacted on December 22, 2017. The Tax Act made significant changes to the U.S.
federal income tax rules for individuals and corporations, generally effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017. The
application of certain provisions of the Tax Act is uncertain, and the changes in the act may have indirect effects on the Funds, its
investments and its shareholders that cannot be predicted. For federal income tax purposes, distributions of investment income are generally
taxable as ordinary income or “qualified dividend income.” Taxes on distributions of capital gains (if any) depend on how
long a Fund owned the assets that generated them, rather than how long a shareholder has owned his or her Fund Shares. Sales of assets
held by a Fund for more than one year generally result in long-term capital gains and losses, and sales of assets held by a Fund for one
year or less generally result in short-term capital gains and losses. Distributions of a Fund’s net capital gain (the excess of
net long-term capital gains over net short-term capital losses) that are properly reported by the Fund as capital gain dividends (“Capital
Gain Dividends”) are taxable as long-term capital gains. For noncorporate shareholders, long-term capital gains are generally subject
to tax at reduced rates and currently set at a maximum rate of 20%. Distributions of short-term capital gain are generally taxable as
ordinary income. Distributions of investment income reported by a Fund as derived from “qualified dividend income” will be
taxed at long term capital gain rates for non- corporate shareholders.</p>

a portion of a dividend as an “interest-related dividend” or a “short-term capital gain dividend,” which would
generally be exempt from this 30% U.S. withholding tax, provided certain other requirements are met. Short-term capital gain dividends
received by a nonresident alien individual who is present in the U.S. for a period or periods aggregating 183 days or more during the
taxable year are not exempt from this 30% withholding tax. Gains realized by foreign shareholders from the sale or other disposition of

received by Fund shareholders beginning after December 31, 2018) for shareholders who own their Shares through foreign accounts or foreign
intermediaries if certain disclosure requirements related to U.S. accounts or ownership are not satisfied. A Fund will not pay any additional

some of those taxes as a distribution to shareholders, which would allow shareholders to offset some of their U.S. federal income tax.

taxes, but may be entitled to either a corresponding tax deduction in calculating taxable income, or, subject to certain limitations,
a credit in calculating federal income tax. If a Fund does not so elect, each such Fund will be entitled to claim a deduction for certain

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">The Trust was organized as a Delaware
statutory trust on February 22, 2023 and is authorized to issue multiple series or portfolios. The Trust is an open-end, management
investment company, registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “1940 Act”). The offering of
the Trust’s shares is registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”). Each
Fund’s ticker symbol appears on the cover of this SAI, and references to specific Funds in the sections below will refer to
such Funds by their ticker symbol.</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">The Funds described in this SAI (except the Themes
Global Systemically Important Banks ETF), seek to track the total return performance, before fees and expenses, of their respective indices
(each an “Index”). The Themes Global Systemically Important Banks ETF is an actively managed ETF that is designed to provide
investors with exposure to the global banking sector.</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">Themes Management Company LLC (the “Adviser”)
is the investment adviser to the Funds. [ALPS Distributors, Inc.] is the distributor (the “Distributor”) of the shares of
the Funds.</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">The Funds issue and redeem shares (“Shares”)
at net asset value per share (“NAV”) only in large blocks of Shares (“Creation Units” or “Creation Unit
Aggregations”). For each Fund a Creation Unit is generally comprised of 25,000 Shares. Creation Unit sizes may change from time
to time. These transactions are usually in exchange for a basket of securities included in its portfolio and an amount of cash. As a practical
matter, only institutions or large investors (authorized participants) who have entered into agreements with the Trust’s Distributor,
can purchase or redeem Creation Units. Except when aggregated in Creation Units, Shares of the Fund are not redeemable securities.</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">Shares of the Funds are listed on the Nasdaq Stock
Market (the “Exchange”), and trade throughout the day on the Exchange and other secondary markets at market prices that may
differ from NAV. As in the case of other publicly traded securities, brokers’ commissions on transactions will be based on negotiated
commission rates at customary levels.</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">The Trust reserves the right to adjust the prices
of Shares in the future to maintain convenient trading ranges for investors. Any adjustments would be accomplished through stock splits
or reverse stock splits, which would have no effect on the net assets of the applicable Fund.</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">Each Fund’s investment objective, principal
investment strategies and associated risks are described in the Funds’ Prospectus. The sections below supplement these principal
investment strategies and risks and describe each Fund’s additional investment policies and the different types of investments that
may be made by a Fund as a part of its non-principal investment strategies. With respect to each Fund’s investments, unless otherwise
noted, if a percentage limitation on investment is adhered to at the time of investment or contract, a subsequent increase or decrease
as a result of market movement or redemption will not result in a violation of such investment limitation.</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">Each Fund intends to qualify each year as a regulated
investment company (a “RIC”) under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”),
so that it will not be subject to federal income tax on income and gains that are timely distributed to Fund shareholders. The Funds will
invest their assets, and otherwise conduct their operations, in a manner that is intended to satisfy the qualifying income, diversification
and distribution requirements necessary to establish and maintain RIC qualification under Subchapter&nbsp;M of the Code.</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">An investment in a Fund should be made with an
understanding that the value of that Fund’s portfolio securities may fluctuate in accordance with changes in the financial condition
of an issuer or counterparty, changes in specific economic, political, public health or cyber conditions that affect a particular security
or issuer and changes in general economic, political, public health or cyber conditions. An investor in the Funds could lose money over
short or long periods of time.</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">An investment in a Fund should also be made with
an understanding of the risks inherent in an investment in equity securities, including the risk that the financial condition of issuers
may become impaired or that the general condition of the stock market may deteriorate (either of which may cause a decrease in the value
of a Fund’s portfolio securities and therefore a decrease in the value of Shares of that Fund). Common stocks are susceptible to
general stock market fluctuations and to volatile increases and decreases in value as market confidence and perceptions change. These
investor perceptions are based on various and unpredictable factors, including expectations regarding government, economic, monetary and
fiscal policies; inflation and interest rates; economic expansion or contraction; and global or regional political, economic, public health,
cyber, or banking crises.</p>

holders of preferred stocks and debt obligations because common stockholders, as owners of the issuer, generally have inferior rights
to receive payments from the issuer in comparison with the rights of creditors or holders of debt obligations or preferred stocks. Further,
unlike debt securities, which typically have a stated principal amount payable at maturity (whose value, however, is subject to market
fluctuations prior thereto), or preferred stocks, which typically have a liquidation preference and which may have stated optional or
mandatory redemption provisions, common stocks have neither a fixed principal amount nor a maturity. Common stock values are subject to
market fluctuations as long as the common stock remains outstanding.</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">Although all of the equity securities in the Indexes
are listed on major U.S. and non-U.S. stock exchanges, there can be no guarantee that a liquid market for the securities held by the Funds
will be maintained. The existence of a liquid trading market for certain securities may depend on whether dealers will make a market in
such securities. There can be no assurance that a market will be made or maintained or that any such market will be or remain liquid.
The price at which securities may be sold and the value of the Shares will be adversely affected if trading markets for a Fund’s

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify"><i>Cyber Security Risk.</i> As the use of technology
has become more prevalent in the course of business, the Funds may be more susceptible to operational and financial risks associated with
cyber security, including: theft, loss, misuse, improper release, corruption and destruction of, or unauthorized access to, confidential
or highly restricted data relating to a Fund and its shareholders; and compromises or failures to systems, networks, devices and applications
relating to the operations of a Fund and its service providers. Cyber security risks may result in financial losses to a Fund and its
shareholders; the inability of a Fund to transact business with its shareholders; delays or mistakes in the calculation of a Fund’s
NAV or other materials provided to shareholders; the inability to process transactions with shareholders or other parties; violations
of privacy and other laws; regulatory fines, penalties and reputational damage; and compliance and remediation costs, legal fees and other
expenses. A Fund’s service providers (including, but not limited to, its investment adviser, any sub-advisers, administrator, transfer
agent, and custodian or their agents), financial intermediaries, companies in which a Fund invests and parties with which a Fund engages
in portfolio or other transactions also may be adversely impacted by cyber security risks in their own businesses, which could result
in losses to a Fund or its shareholders. While measures have been developed which are designed to reduce the risks associated with cyber
security, there is no guarantee that those measures will be effective, particularly since the Funds do not directly control the cyber
security defenses or plans of their service providers, financial intermediaries and companies in which they invest or with which they
do business.</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify"><i>Pandemic Risk. </i>The global pandemic caused
by COVID-19, a novel coronavirus has resulted in a wide range of social and economic disruptions, including closed borders, voluntary
or compelled quarantines of large populations, stressed healthcare systems, reduced or prohibited domestic or international travel, supply
chain disruptions, and so-called “stay-at-home” orders throughout much of the United States and many other countries. The
fall-out from these disruptions has included the rapid closure of businesses deemed “non-essential” by federal, state, or
local governments and rapidly increasing unemployment, as well as greatly reduced liquidity for certain instruments at times. Some sectors
of the economy and individual issuers have experienced particularly large losses.&nbsp;Such disruptions may continue for an extended period
of time or reoccur in the future to a similar or greater extent. It is unknown how long circumstances related to the pandemic will persist,
whether they will reoccur in the future, whether efforts to support the economy and financial markets will be successful, and what additional
implications may follow from the pandemic. The impact of these events and other epidemics or pandemics in the future could adversely affect
Fund performance.</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">The following are descriptions of the Funds’
permitted investments and investment practices and the associated risk factors. A Fund will only invest in any of the following instruments

and permitted by a Fund’s stated investment policies. See the Funds’ prospectus for additional information on the Funds’

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify"><b>BORROWING. </b>While the Funds do not intend
to borrow for investment purposes, the Funds reserve the right to do so. Borrowing for investment purposes is a form of leverage. Leveraging
investments, by purchasing securities with borrowed money, is a speculative technique that increases investment risk, but also increases
investment opportunity. The Funds also may enter into certain transactions, including reverse repurchase agreements, which can be viewed
as constituting a form of leveraging by the Funds. Leveraging will exaggerate the effect on the net asset value per share (“NAV”)
of the Funds of any increase or decrease in the market value of the Funds’ portfolio. Because substantially all of the Funds’
assets will fluctuate in value, whereas the interest obligations on borrowings may be fixed, the NAV of the Funds will increase more when
the Funds’ portfolio assets increase in value and decrease more when the Funds’ portfolio assets decrease in value than would
otherwise be the case. Moreover, interest costs on borrowings may fluctuate with changing market rates of interest and may partially offset
or exceed the returns on the borrowed funds. Under adverse conditions, the Funds might have to sell portfolio securities to meet interest
or principal payments at a time when investment considerations would not favor such sales. Generally, the Funds would use this form of
leverage during periods when the Advisor believes that the Funds’ investment objective would be furthered.</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">The Funds also may borrow money to facilitate
management of the Funds’ portfolio by enabling the Funds to meet redemption requests when the liquidation of portfolio instruments
would be inconvenient or disadvantageous. Such borrowing is not for investment purposes and will be repaid by the Funds promptly. As required
by the 1940 Act, the Funds must maintain continuous asset coverage (total assets, including assets acquired with borrowed funds, less
liabilities exclusive of borrowings) of 300% of all amounts borrowed. If, at any time, the value of the Funds’ assets should fail
to meet this 300% coverage test, the Funds, within three days (not including Sundays and holidays), will reduce the amount of the Funds’
borrowings to the extent necessary to meet this 300% coverage requirement. Maintenance of this percentage limitation may result in the
sale of portfolio securities at a time when investment considerations otherwise indicate that it would be disadvantageous to do so.</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">In addition to the foregoing, the Funds are authorized
to borrow money as a temporary measure for extraordinary or emergency purposes in amounts not in excess of 5% of the value of the Funds’
total assets. Borrowings for extraordinary or emergency purposes are not subject to the foregoing 300% asset coverage requirement. While
the Funds do not anticipate doing so, the Funds are authorized to pledge (<i>i.e.</i>, transfer a security interest in) portfolio securities
in an amount up to one-third of the value of the Funds’ total assets in connection with any borrowing.</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify"><b>CONCENTRATION. </b>A Fund may concentrate its
investments in a particular industry or group of industries, as described in the Prospectus. The securities of issuers in particular industries
may dominate a Fund’s Index and consequently the Fund’s portfolio. This may adversely affect the Fund’s performance
or subject its shares to greater price volatility than that experienced by less concentrated investment companies. Themes Global Systemically

Funds invest in stocks of foreign corporations, a Fund’s investment in securities of foreign companies may be in the form of depositary
receipts or other securities convertible into securities of foreign issuers. ADRs are receipts that are traded in the United States evidencing
ownership of the underlying foreign securities and are denominated in U.S. dollars. GDRs are receipts issued by a non-U.S. financial institution
evidencing ownership of underlying foreign or U.S. securities and usually are denominated in foreign currencies. GDRs may not be denominated
in the same currency as the securities they represent. Generally, GDRs are designed for use in the foreign securities markets. To the
extent each Fund invests in ADRs, such ADRs will be listed on a national securities exchange. To the extent each Fund invests in GDRs,
such GDRs will be listed on a foreign exchange.</p>

Receipts or any Depositary Receipt that the Adviser deems to be illiquid or for which pricing information is not readily available. In
addition, all Depositary Receipts generally must be sponsored; however, the Funds may invest in unsponsored Depositary Receipts under
certain limited circumstances. The issuers of unsponsored Depositary Receipts are not obligated to disclose material information in the
United States, and, therefore, there may be less information available regarding such issuers and there may not be a correlation between
such information and the market value of the Depositary Receipts. The use of Depositary Receipts may increase tracking error relative

new common stock at a lower price than the public offering price. Warrants are securities that are usually issued together with a debt
security or preferred stock and that give the holder the right to buy proportionate amount of common stock at a specified price. Warrants
are freely transferable and are traded on major exchanges. Unlike rights, warrants normally have a life that is measured in years and
entitles the holder to buy common stock of a company at a price that is usually higher than the market price at the time the warrant is
issued. Corporations often issue warrants to make the accompanying debt security more attractive.</p>

In addition, their value does not necessarily change with the value of the underlying securities, and they cease to have value if they
are not exercised on or before their expiration date. Investing in rights and warrants increases the potential profit or loss to be realized
from the investment as compared with investing the same amount in the underlying securities.</p>

based ETFs invest in a securities portfolio that includes substantially all of the securities in substantially the same amount as the
securities included in the designated index. Because passively managed ETFs are designed to track an index, securities may be purchased,
retained and sold at times when an actively managed ETF would not do so. As a result, shareholders of a Fund that invest in such an ETF
can expect greater risk of loss (and a correspondingly greater prospect of gain) from changes in the value of securities that are heavily
weighted in the index than would be the case if ETF were not fully invested in such securities. This risk is increased if a few component

invest in fixed income securities. Even though interest-bearing securities are investments that promise a stable stream of income, the
prices of such securities are affected by changes in interest rates. In general, fixed income security prices rise when interest rates
fall and fall when interest rates rise. Securities with shorter maturities, while offering lower yields, generally provide greater price
stability than longer term securities and are less affected by changes in interest rates. The values of fixed income securities also may
be affected by changes in the credit rating or financial condition of the issuing entities. Once the rating of a portfolio security has
been changed, the Funds will consider all circumstances deemed relevant in determining whether to continue to hold the security.</p>

bank’s monetary policies or general improvements in the economy, may cause interest rates to rise. Fixed income securities with

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify"><b>FIXED-INCOME SECURITIES RATINGS.</b> Nationally
recognized statistical rating organizations (together, rating agency) publish ratings based upon their assessment of the relative creditworthiness
of rated fixed-income securities. Generally, a lower rating indicates higher credit risk, and higher yields are ordinarily available from
fixed-income securities in the lower rating categories to compensate investors for the increased credit risk. Any use of credit ratings
in evaluating fixed-income securities can involve certain risks. For example, ratings assigned by the rating agencies are based upon an
analysis completed at the time of the rating of the obligor’s ability to pay interest and repay principal, typically relying to
a large extent on historical data. Rating agencies typically rely to a large extent on historical data which may not accurately represent
present or future circumstances. Ratings do not purport to reflect to risk of fluctuations in market value of the fixed-income security
and are not absolute standards of quality and only express the rating agency’s current opinion of an obligor’s overall financial
capacity to pay its financial obligations. A credit rating is not a statement of fact or a recommendation to purchase, sell or hold a
fixed-income obligation. Also, credit quality can change suddenly and unexpectedly, and credit ratings may not reflect the issuer’s
current financial condition or events since the security was last rated. Rating agencies may have a financial interest in generating business,
including the arranger or issuer of the security that normally pays for that rating, and a low rating might affect future business. While
rating agencies have policies and procedures to address this potential conflict of interest, there is a risk that these policies will
fail to prevent a conflict of interest from impacting the rating. Additionally, legislation has been enacted in an effort to reform rating
agencies. The SEC has also adopted rules to require rating agencies to provide additional disclosure and reduce conflicts of interest,
and further reform has been proposed. It is uncertain how such legislation or additional regulation might impact the ratings agencies
business and the Adviser’s investment process.</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">Prepayment risk occurs when a fixed-income investment
held by a Fund may be repaid in whole or in part prior to its maturity. The amount of prepayable obligations a Fund invests in from time
to time may be affected by general business conditions, market interest rates, borrowers’ financial conditions and competitive conditions
among lenders. In a period of declining interest rates, borrowers may repay investments more quickly than anticipated, reducing the yield
to maturity and the average life of the relevant investment. Moreover, when a Fund reinvests the proceeds of a prepayment in these circumstances,
it will likely receive a rate of interest that is lower than the rate on the security that was prepaid. To the extent that a Fund purchases
a relevant investment at a premium, prepayments may result in a loss to the extent of the premium paid. If a Fund buys such investments
at a discount, both scheduled payments and unscheduled prepayments will increase current and total returns and unscheduled prepayments
will also accelerate the recognition of income. In a period of rising interest rates, prepayments of investments may occur at a slower
than expected rate, creating maturity extension risk. This particular risk may effectively change an investment that was considered short-
or intermediate-term at the time of purchase into a longer-term investment. Since the value of longer-term investments generally fluctuates
more widely in response to changes in interest rates than short-term investments, maturity extension risk could increase the volatility
of a Fund. When interest rates decline, the value of an investment with prepayment features may not increase as much as that of other
fixed-income securities and, as noted above, changes in market rates of interest may accelerate or delay prepayments and thus affect maturities.</p>

stocks, bonds, interest rates, currency exchange rates, and related indexes. Derivatives include futures contracts and options on futures
contracts, certain forward-commitment transactions, options on securities, caps, floors, collars, swap agreements, and certain other financial
instruments. Some derivatives, such as futures contracts and certain options, are traded on U.S. commodity and securities exchanges, while
other derivatives, such as swap agreements, may be privately negotiated and entered into in the over-the-counter market (OTC Derivatives)
or may be cleared through a clearinghouse (Cleared Derivatives) and traded on an exchange or swap execution facility. As a result of the
Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Dodd-Frank Act), certain swap agreements, such as certain standardized
credit default and interest rate swap agreements, must be cleared through a clearinghouse and traded on an exchange or swap execution
facility. This could result in an increase in the overall costs of such transactions. While the intent of derivatives regulatory reform
is to mitigate risks associated with derivatives markets, the regulations could, among other things, increase liquidity and decrease pricing
for more standardized products while decreasing liquidity and increasing pricing for less standardized products. The risks associated
with the use of derivatives are different from, and possibly greater than, the risks associated with investing directly in the securities

seeking to simulate an investment in equity or debt securities or other investments, and seeking to add value by using derivatives to
more efficiently implement portfolio positions when derivatives are favorably priced relative to equity or debt securities or other investments.
Some investors may use derivatives primarily for speculative purposes while other uses of derivatives may not constitute speculation.
There is no assurance that any derivatives strategy used by a fund’s advisor will succeed. The other parties to a fund’s OTC

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">For OTC Derivatives, a fund is subject to the
risk that a loss may be sustained as a result of the insolvency or bankruptcy of the counterparty or the failure of the counterparty to
make required payments or otherwise comply with the terms of the contract. Additionally, the use of credit derivatives can result in losses
if a fund’s advisor does not correctly evaluate the creditworthiness of the issuer on which the credit derivative is based.</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">Derivatives may be subject to liquidity risk,
which exists when a particular derivative is difficult to purchase or sell. If a derivative transaction is particularly large or if the
relevant market is illiquid (as is the case with certain OTC Derivatives), it may not be possible to initiate a transaction or liquidate
a position at an advantageous time or price.</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">Derivatives may be subject to pricing or “basis”
risk, which exists when a particular derivative becomes extraordinarily expensive relative to historical prices or the prices of corresponding
cash market instruments. Under certain market conditions, it may not be economically feasible to initiate a transaction or liquidate a
position in time to avoid a loss or take advantage of an opportunity.</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">Because certain derivatives have a leverage component,
adverse changes in the value or level of the underlying asset, reference rate, or index can result in a loss substantially greater than
the amount invested in the derivative itself. Certain derivatives have the potential for unlimited loss, regardless of the size of the
initial investment. A derivative transaction will not be considered to constitute the issuance, by a fund, of a “senior security,”
as that term is defined in Section 18(g) of the 1940 Act, and therefore such transaction will not be subject to the 300% asset coverage
requirement otherwise applicable to borrowings by a fund, if the fund complies with Rule 18f-4.</p>

are subject to the risk that the market value of the instrument will change in a way detrimental to a fund’s interest. A fund bears
the risk that its advisor will incorrectly forecast future market trends or the values of assets, reference rates, indexes, or other financial
or economic factors in establishing derivative positions for the fund. If the advisor attempts to use a derivative as a hedge against,
or as a substitute for, a portfolio investment, the fund will be exposed to the risk that the derivative will have or will develop imperfect
or no correlation with the portfolio investment. This could cause substantial losses for the fund. Although hedging strategies involving
derivative instruments can reduce the risk of loss, they can also reduce the opportunity for gain or even result in losses by offsetting
favorable price movements in other fund investments. Many derivatives (in particular, OTC Derivatives) are complex and often valued subjectively.
Improper valuations can result in increased cash payment requirements to counterparties or a loss of value to a fund.</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">Rule 18f-4 imposes limits on the amount of derivatives
a fund can enter into, eliminates the asset segregation framework currently used by funds to comply with Section 18 of the 1940 Act, as

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify"><b>FUTURES CONTRACTS AND OPTIONS ON FUTURES CONTRACTS.</b>
The Funds may at times invest in futures contracts and options on futures contracts. Futures contracts and options on futures contracts
are derivatives. A futures contract is a standardized agreement between two parties to buy or sell at a specific time in the future a
specific quantity of a commodity at a specific price. The commodity may consist of an asset, a reference rate, or an index. A security
futures contract relates to the sale of a specific quantity of shares of a single equity security or a narrow-based securities index.
The value of a futures contract tends to increase and decrease in tandem with the value of the underlying commodity. The buyer of a futures
contract enters into an agreement to purchase the underlying commodity on the settlement date and is said to be “long” the
contract. The seller of a futures contract enters into an agreement to sell the underlying commodity on the settlement date and is said
to be “short” the contract. The price at which a futures contract is entered into is established either in the electronic
marketplace or by open outcry on the floor of an exchange between exchange members acting as traders or brokers. Open futures contracts
can be liquidated or closed out by physical delivery of the underlying commodity or payment of the cash settlement amount on the settlement
date, depending on the terms of the particular contract. Some financial futures contracts (such as security futures) provide for physical
settlement at maturity. Other financial futures contracts (such as those relating to interest rates, foreign currencies, and broad-based
securities indexes) generally provide for cash settlement at maturity. In the case of cash-settled futures contracts, the cash settlement
amount is equal to the difference between the final settlement or market price for the relevant commodity on the last trading day of the
contract and the price for the relevant commodity agreed upon at the outset of the contract. Most futures contracts, however, are not
held until maturity but instead are “offset” before the settlement date through the establishment of an opposite and equal
futures position.</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">The purchaser or seller of a futures contract
is not required to deliver or pay for the underlying commodity unless the contract is held until the settlement date. However, both the
purchaser and seller are required to deposit “initial margin” with a futures commission merchant (FCM) when the futures contract
is entered into. Initial margin deposits are typically calculated as an amount equal to the volatility in market value of a contract over
a fixed period. If the value of the fund’s position declines, the fund will be required to make additional “variation margin”
payments to the FCM to settle the change in value. If the value of the fund’s position increases, the FCM will be required to make
additional “variation margin” payments to the fund to settle the change in value. This process is known as “marking-to-market”
and is calculated on a daily basis. A futures transaction will not be considered to constitute the issuance, by a fund, of a “senior
security,” as that term is defined in Section 18(g) of the 1940 Act, and therefore such transaction will not be subject to the 300%
asset coverage requirement otherwise applicable to borrowings by a fund, if the fund complies with Rule 18f-4.</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">An option on a futures contract (or futures option)
conveys the right, but not the obligation, to purchase (in the case of a call option) or sell (in the case of a put option) a specific
futures contract at a specific price (called the “exercise” or “strike” price) any time before the option expires.
The seller of an option is called an option writer. The purchase price of an option is called the premium. The potential loss to an option
buyer is limited to the amount of the premium plus transaction costs. This will be the case, for example, if the option is held and not
exercised prior to its expiration date. Generally, an option writer sells options with the goal of obtaining the premium paid by the option
buyer. If an option sold by an option writer expires without being exercised, the writer retains the full amount of the premium. The option
writer, however, has unlimited economic risk because its potential loss, except to the extent offset by the premium received when the
option was written, is equal to the amount the option is “in-the-money” at the expiration date. A call option is in-the-money
if the value of the underlying futures contract exceeds the exercise price of the option. A put option is in-the-money if the exercise
price of the option exceeds the value of the underlying futures contract. Generally, any profit realized by an option buyer represents
a loss for the option writer.</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">A fund that takes the position of a writer of
a futures option is required to deposit and maintain initial and variation margin with respect to the option, as previously described
in the case of futures contracts. A futures option transaction will not be considered to constitute the issuance, by a fund, of a “senior
security,” as that term is defined in Section 18(g) of the 1940 Act, and therefore such transaction will not be subject to the 300%
asset coverage requirement otherwise applicable to borrowings by a fund, if the fund complies with Rule 18f-4.</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">The risk of loss in trading futures contracts
and in writing futures options can be substantial because of the low margin deposits required, the extremely high degree of leverage involved
in futures and options pricing, and the potential high volatility of the futures markets. As a result, a relatively small price movement
in a futures position may result in immediate and substantial loss (or gain) for the investor. For example, if at the time of purchase,
10% of the value of the futures contract is deposited as margin, a subsequent 10% decrease in the value of the futures contract would
result in a total loss of the margin deposit, before any deduction for the transaction costs, if the account were then closed out. A 15%
decrease would result in a loss equal to 150% of the original margin deposit if the contract were closed out. Thus, a purchase or sale
of a futures contract, and the writing of a futures option, may result in losses in excess of the amount invested in the position. In
the event of adverse price movements, a fund would continue to be required to make daily cash payments to maintain its required margin.
In such situations, if the fund has insufficient cash, it may have to sell portfolio securities to meet daily margin requirements (and
segregation requirements, if applicable) at a time when it may be disadvantageous to do so. In addition, on the settlement date, a fund
may be required to make delivery of the instruments underlying the futures positions it holds.</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">A fund could suffer losses if it is unable to
close out a futures contract or a futures option because of an illiquid secondary market. Futures contracts and futures options may be
closed out only on an exchange that provides a secondary market for such products. However, there can be no assurance that a liquid secondary
market will exist for any particular futures product at any specific time. Thus, it may not be possible to close a futures or option position.
Moreover, most futures exchanges limit the amount of fluctuation permitted in futures contract prices during a single trading day. The
daily limit establishes the maximum amount that the price of a futures contract may vary either up or down from the previous day’s
settlement price at the end of a trading session. Once the daily limit has been reached in a particular type of contract, no trades may
be made on that day at a price beyond that limit. The daily limit governs only price movement during a particular trading day, and therefore
does not limit potential losses because the limit may prevent the liquidation of unfavorable positions. Futures contract prices have occasionally
moved to the daily limit for several consecutive trading days with little or no trading, thereby preventing prompt liquidation of future
positions and subjecting some futures traders to substantial losses. The inability to close futures and options positions also could have
an adverse impact on the ability to hedge a portfolio investment or to establish a substitute for a portfolio investment. U.S. Treasury
futures are generally not subject to such daily limits.</p>

predict future market trends. If the advisor attempts to use a futures contract or a futures option as a hedge against, or as a substitute
for, a portfolio investment, the fund will be exposed to the risk that the futures position will have or will develop imperfect or no
correlation with the portfolio investment. This could cause substantial losses for the fund. Although hedging strategies involving futures
products can reduce the risk of loss, they can also reduce the opportunity for gain or even result in losses by offsetting favorable price
movements in other fund investments.</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">A fund could lose margin payments it has deposited
with its FCM if, for example, the FCM breaches its agreement with the fund or becomes insolvent or goes into bankruptcy. In that event,
the fund may be entitled to return of margin owed to it only in proportion to the amount received by the FCM’s other customers,
potentially resulting in losses to the fund.</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify"><b>OPTIONS.</b> The Funds may at times invest
in options. An option is a derivative. An option on a security (or index) is a contract that gives the holder of the option, in return
for the payment of a “premium,” the right, but not the obligation, to buy from (in the case of a call option) or sell to (in
the case of a put option) the writer of the option the security underlying the option (or the cash value of the index) at a specified
exercise price prior to the expiration date of the option. The writer of an option on a security has the obligation upon exercise of the
option to deliver the underlying security upon payment of the exercise price (in the case of a call option) or to pay the exercise price
upon delivery of the underlying security (in the case of a put option). The writer of an option on an index has the obligation upon exercise
of the option to pay an amount equal to the cash value of the index minus the exercise price, multiplied by the specified multiplier for
the index option. The multiplier for an index option determines the size of the investment position the option represents. Unlike exchange-traded
options, which are standardized with respect to the underlying instrument, expiration date, contract size, and strike price, the terms
of over-the-counter (OTC) options (options not traded on exchanges) generally are established through negotiation with the other party
to the option contract. Although this type of arrangement allows the purchaser or writer greater flexibility to tailor an option to its
needs, OTC options generally involve credit risk to the counterparty, whereas for exchange-traded, centrally cleared options, credit risk
is mutualized through the involvement of the applicable clearing house.</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">The buyer (or holder) of an option is said to
be “long” the option, while the seller (or writer) of an option is said to be “short” the option. A call option
grants to the holder the right to buy (and obligates the writer to sell) the underlying security at the strike price, which is the predetermined
price at which the option may be exercised. A put option grants to the holder the right to sell (and obligates the writer to buy) the
underlying security at the strike price. The purchase price of an option is called the “premium.” The potential loss to an
option buyer is limited to the amount of the premium plus transaction costs. This will be the case if the option is held and not exercised
prior to its expiration date. Generally, an option writer sells options with the goal of obtaining the premium paid by the option buyer,
but that person could also seek to profit from an anticipated rise or decline in option prices. If an option sold by an option writer
expires without being exercised, the writer retains the full amount of the premium. The option writer, however, has unlimited economic
risk because its potential loss, except to the extent offset by the premium received when the option was written, is equal to the amount
the option is “in-the-money” at the expiration date. A call option is in-the-money if the value of the underlying position
exceeds the exercise price of the option. A put option is in-the-money if the exercise price of the option exceeds the value of the underlying
position. Generally, any profit realized by an option buyer represents a loss for the option writer. The writing of an option will not
be considered to constitute the issuance, by a fund, of a “senior security,” as that term is defined in Section 18(g) of the
1940 Act, and therefore such transaction will not be subject to the 300% asset coverage requirement otherwise applicable to borrowings
by a fund, if the fund complies with Rule 18f-4.</p>

to become unavailable, investors in those options (such as the funds) would be unable to close out their positions until trading resumes,
and they may be faced with substantial losses if the value of the underlying instrument moves adversely during that time. Even if the
market were to remain available, there may be times when options prices will not maintain their customary or anticipated relationships
to the prices of the underlying instruments and related instruments. Lack of investor interest, changes in volatility, or other factors
or conditions might adversely affect the liquidity, efficiency, continuity, or even the orderliness of the market for particular options.</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify"><b>OTC SWAP AGREEMENTS.</b> The Funds may at times
invest in swap agreements. An over-the-counter (OTC) swap agreement, which is a type of derivative, is an agreement between two parties
(counterparties) to exchange payments at specified dates (periodic payment dates) on the basis of a specified amount (notional amount)
with the payments calculated with reference to a specified asset, reference rate, or index.</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">Examples of OTC swap agreements include, but are
not limited to, interest rate swaps, credit default swaps, equity swaps, commodity swaps, foreign currency swaps, index swaps, excess
return swaps, and total return swaps. Most OTC swap agreements provide that when the periodic payment dates for both parties are the same,
payments are netted and only the net amount is paid to the counterparty entitled to receive the net payment. Consequently, a fund’s
current obligations (or rights) under an OTC swap agreement will generally be equal only to the net amount to be paid or received under
the agreement, based on the relative values of the positions held by each counterparty. OTC swap agreements allow for a wide variety of
transactions. For example, fixed rate payments may be exchanged for floating rate payments; U.S. dollar-denominated payments may be exchanged
for payments denominated in a different currency; and payments tied to the price of one asset, reference rate, or index may be exchanged
for payments tied to the price of another asset, reference rate, or index.</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">An OTC option on an OTC swap agreement, also called
a “swaption,” is an option that gives the buyer the right, but not the obligation, to enter into a swap on a future date in
exchange for paying a market-based “premium.” A receiver swaption gives the owner the right to receive the total return of
a specified asset, reference rate, or index. A payer swaption gives the owner the right to pay the total return of a specified asset,
reference rate, or index. Swaptions also include options that allow an existing swap to be terminated or extended by one of the counterparties.</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">The use of OTC swap agreements by a fund entails
certain risks, which may be different from, or possibly greater than, the risks associated with investing directly in the securities and
other investments that are the referenced asset for the swap agreement. OTC swaps are highly specialized instruments that require investment
techniques, risk analyses, and tax planning different from those associated with stocks, bonds, and other traditional investments. The
use of an OTC swap requires an understanding not only of the referenced asset, reference rate, or index but also of the swap itself, without
the benefit of observing the performance of the swap under all possible market conditions.</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">OTC swap agreements may be subject to liquidity
risk, which exists when a particular swap is difficult to purchase or sell. If an OTC swap transaction is particularly large or if the
relevant market is illiquid (as is the case with many OTC swaps), it may not be possible to initiate a transaction or liquidate a position
at an advantageous time or price, which may result in significant losses. In addition, OTC swap transactions may be subject to a fund’s
limitation on investments in illiquid securities.</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">OTC swap agreements may be subject to pricing
risk, which exists when a particular swap becomes extraordinarily expensive or inexpensive relative to historical prices or the prices
of corresponding cash market instruments. Under certain market conditions, it may not be economically feasible to initiate a transaction
or liquidate a position in time to avoid a loss or take advantage of an opportunity or to realize the intrinsic value of the OTC swap
agreement.</p>

component, adverse changes in the value or level of the underlying asset, reference rate, or index can result in a loss substantially
greater than the amount invested in the swap itself. Certain OTC swaps have the potential for unlimited loss, regardless of the size of
the initial investment. A leveraged OTC swap transaction will not be considered to constitute the issuance, by a fund, of a “senior
security,” as that term is defined in Section 18(g) of the 1940 Act, and therefore such transaction will not be subject to the 300%

are subject to the risk that the market value of the instrument will change in a way detrimental to a fund’s interest. A fund bears
the risk that its advisor will not accurately forecast future market trends or the values of assets, reference rates, indexes, or other
economic factors in establishing OTC swap positions for the fund. If the advisor attempts to use an OTC swap as a hedge against, or as

favorable price movements in other fund investments. Many OTC swaps are complex and often valued subjectively. Improper valuations can
result in increased cash payment requirements to counterparties or a loss of value to a fund.</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">The use of an OTC swap agreement also involves
the risk that a loss may be sustained as a result of the insolvency or bankruptcy of the counterparty or the failure of the counterparty
to make required payments or otherwise comply with the terms of the agreement. Additionally, the use of credit default swaps can result
in losses if a fund’s advisor does not correctly evaluate the creditworthiness of the issuer on which the credit swap is based.</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify"><b>MASTER LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS (“MLPs”).</b>
MLPs are limited partnerships in which the ownership units are publicly traded. MLP units are registered with the SEC and are freely traded
on a securities exchange or in the OTC market. MLPs often own several properties or businesses (or own interests) that are related to
real estate development and oil and gas industries, but they also may finance motion pictures, research and development and other projects.
Generally, an MLP is operated under the supervision of one or more managing general partners. Limited partners are not involved in the
day-to-day management of the partnership.</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify"><b>&nbsp;</b></p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">The risks of investing in an MLP are generally
those involved in investing in a partnership as opposed to a corporation. For example, state law governing partnerships is often less
restrictive than state law governing corporations. Accordingly, there may be fewer protections afforded investors in an MLP than investors
in a corporation. Additional risks involved with investing in an MLP are risks associated with the specific industry or industries in
which the partnership invests, such as the risks of investing in real estate, or oil and gas industries.</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">MLPs are generally treated as partnerships for
U.S. federal income tax purposes. When a Fund invests in the equity securities of an MLP or any other entity that is treated as a partnership
for U.S. federal income tax purposes, a Fund will be treated as a partner in the entity for tax purposes. Accordingly, in calculating
the Fund’s taxable income, it will be required to take into account its allocable share of the income, gains, losses, deductions,
and credits recognized by each such entity, regardless of whether the entity distributes cash to the Fund. Distributions from such an
entity to a Fund are not generally taxable unless the cash amount (or, in certain cases, the fair market value of marketable securities)
distributed to a Fund exceeds the Fund’s adjusted tax basis in its interest in the entity. In general, the Fund’s allocable
share of such an entity’s net income will increase the Fund’s adjusted tax basis in its interest in the entity, and distributions
to a Fund from such an entity and the Fund’s allocable share of the entity’s net losses will decrease the Fund’s adjusted
basis in its interest in the entity, but not below zero. A Fund may receive cash distributions from such an entity in excess of the net
amount of taxable income a Fund is allocated from its investment in the entity. In other circumstances, the net amount of taxable income
a Fund is allocated from its investment in such an entity may exceed cash distributions received from the entity. Thus, the Fund’s
investments in such an entity may lead a Fund to make distributions in excess of its earnings and profits, or a Fund may be required to
sell investments, including when not otherwise advantageous to do so, in order to satisfy the distribution requirements applicable to
regulated investment companies under the Code.</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">Depreciation or other cost recovery deductions
passed through to a Fund from any investments in MLPs in a given year will generally reduce the Fund’s taxable income, but those
deductions may be recaptured in the Fund’s income in one or more subsequent years. When recognized and distributed, recapture income
will generally be taxable to the Fund’s shareholders at the time of the distribution at ordinary income tax rates, even though those
shareholders might not have held Shares in a Fund at the time the deductions were taken, and even though those shareholders may not have
corresponding economic gain on their Shares at the time of the recapture. To distribute recapture income or to fund redemption requests,
a Fund may need to liquidate investments, which may lead to additional taxable income.</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify"><b>NON-DIVERSIFICATION.</b> Each Fund is classified
as a non-diversified investment company under the 1940 Act. A “non-diversified” classification means that a Fund is not limited
by the 1940 Act with regard to the percentage of its assets that may be invested in the securities of a single issuer. This means that
a Fund may invest a greater portion of its assets in the securities of a single issuer or a small number of issuers than if it was a diversified
fund. The securities of a particular issuer may constitute a greater portion of the Index and, therefore, those securities may constitute
a greater portion of a Fund’s portfolio. This may have an adverse effect on a Fund’s performance or subject a Fund’s
Shares to greater price volatility than more diversified investment companies. Moreover, in pursuing its objective, a Fund may hold the
securities of a single issuer in an amount exceeding 10% of the value of the outstanding securities of the issuer, subject to restrictions
imposed by the Code. In particular, as a Fund’s size grows and its assets increase, it will be more likely to hold more than 10%
of the securities of a single issuer if the issuer has a relatively small public float as compared to other components in the Index.</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">Although each Fund is non-diversified for purposes
of the 1940 Act, each Fund intends to maintain the required level of diversification and otherwise conduct its operations so as to qualify
as a RIC for purposes of the Code, and to relieve a Fund of any liability for federal income tax to the extent that its earnings are distributed
to shareholders. Compliance with the diversification requirements of the Code may limit the investment flexibility of a Fund and may make
it less likely that a Fund will meet its investment objectives. See “Federal Income Taxes” in this SAI for further discussion.</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify"><b>NON-U.S. SECURITIES. </b>The Funds may invest
in non-U.S. securities. Investments in non-U.S. securities involve certain risks that may not be present in investments in U.S. securities.
For example, non-U.S. securities may be subject to currency risks or to political, social, or economic instability. There may be less
information publicly available about a non-U.S. issuer than about a U.S. issuer, and a foreign issuer may or may not be subject to uniform
accounting, auditing and financial reporting standards and practices comparable to those in the U.S. Investments in non-U.S. securities
may be subject to withholding or other taxes and may be subject to additional trading, settlement, custodial, and operational risks. Other
risks of investing in such securities include political, social, or economic instability in the country involved, the difficulty of predicting
international trade patterns and the possibility of imposition of exchange controls. The prices of such securities may be more volatile
than those of domestic securities. With respect to certain foreign countries, there is a possibility of expropriation of assets or nationalization,
imposition of withholding taxes on dividend or interest payments, difficulty in obtaining and enforcing judgments against foreign entities
or diplomatic developments which could affect investment in these countries. Losses and other expenses may be incurred in converting between
various currencies in connection with purchases and sales of foreign securities. Because foreign exchanges may be open on days when the
Funds do not price their Shares, the value of the securities in a Fund’s portfolio may change on days when shareholders will not
be able to purchase or sell Shares. Conversely, Shares may trade on days when foreign exchanges are closed. Each of these factors can
make investments in the Funds more volatile and potentially less liquid than other types of investments.</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">Non-U.S. stock markets may not be as developed
or efficient as, and may be more volatile than, those in the U.S. While the volume of shares traded on non-U.S. stock markets generally
has been growing, such markets usually have substantially less volume than U.S. markets. Therefore, a Fund’s investment in non-U.S.
equity securities may be less liquid and subject to more rapid and erratic price movements than comparable securities listed for trading
on U.S. exchanges. Non-U.S. equity securities may trade at price/earnings multiples higher than comparable U.S. securities and such levels
may not be sustainable. There may be less government supervision and regulation of foreign stock exchanges, brokers, banks and listed
companies abroad than in the U.S. Moreover, settlement practices for transactions in foreign markets may differ from those in U.S. markets.
Such differences may include delays beyond periods customary in the U.S. and practices, such as delivery of securities prior to receipt
of payment, that increase the likelihood of a failed settlement, which can result in losses to the Funds. The value of non-U.S. investments
and the investment income derived from them may also be affected unfavorably by changes in currency exchange control regulations. Foreign
brokerage commissions, custodial expenses and other fees are also generally higher than for securities traded in the U.S. This may cause
the Funds to incur higher portfolio transaction costs than domestic equity funds. Fluctuations in exchange rates may also affect the earning
power and asset value of the foreign entity issuing a security, even one denominated in U.S. dollars. Dividend and interest payments may
be repatriated based on the exchange rate at the time of disbursement, and restrictions on capital flows may be imposed.</p>

than investing in developed foreign markets. The risks of investing in these markets may be exacerbated relative to investments in foreign

and emerging market countries may have less developed securities markets or exchanges, and legal and accounting systems. It may be more
difficult to sell securities at acceptable prices and security prices may be more volatile than in countries with more mature markets.
Currency values may fluctuate more in developing or emerging markets. Developing or emerging market countries may be more likely to impose
government restrictions, including confiscatory taxation, expropriation or nationalization of a company’s assets, and restrictions
on foreign ownership of local companies. In addition, emerging markets may impose restrictions on the Funds’ ability to repatriate
investment income or capital and thus, may adversely affect the operations of the Funds. Certain emerging markets may impose constraints
on currency exchange and some currencies in emerging markets may have been devalued significantly against the U.S. dollar. For these and
other reasons, the prices of securities in emerging markets can fluctuate more significantly than the prices of securities of companies
in developed countries. The less developed the country, the greater effect these risks may have on the Funds.</p>

the growth rate of China’s economy has recently slowed. Although this slowdown was to some degree intentional, the slowdown has
also slowed the once rapidly growing Chinese real estate market and left local governments with high debts with few viable means to raise
revenue, especially with the fall in demand for housing. Despite its attempts to restructure its economy towards consumption, China remains
heavily dependent on exports. Accordingly, China is susceptible to economic downturns abroad, including any weakness in demand from its
major trading partners, including the United States, Japan, and Europe. Reduction in spending on Chinese products and services, institution
of additional tariffs or other trade barriers (including as a result of heightened trade tensions between China and the U.S. or in response
to actual or alleged Chinese cyber activity) or a downturn in any of the economies of China’s key trading partners may have an adverse
impact on the Chinese economy and the Chinese issuers of securities in which a Fund invests. For example, the U.S. has added certain foreign
technology companies to the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Bureau of Industry and Security’s “Entity List,” which
is a list of companies believed to pose a national security risk to the U.S. Actions like these may have unanticipated and disruptive
effects on the Chinese economy. Any such response that targets Chinese financial markets or securities exchanges could interfere with
orderly trading, delay settlement or cause market disruptions. In addition, China’s aging infrastructure, worsening environmental
conditions, rapid and inequitable urbanization, quickly widening urban and rural income gap, domestic unrest and provincial separatism
all present major challenges to the country. Further, China’s territorial claims, including its land reclamation projects and the
establishment of an Air Defense Identification Zone over islands claimed and occupied by Japan, are another source of tension and present
risks to diplomatic and trade relations with certain of China’s regional trade partners.</p>

to certain political risks not associated with other investments. Following the establishment of the People’s Republic of China
by the Communist Party in 1949, the Chinese government renounced various debt obligations incurred by China’s predecessor governments,
which obligations remain in default, and expropriated assets without compensation. There can be no assurance that the Chinese government
will not take similar action in the future. Investments in China and Hong Kong involve risk of a total loss due to government action or
inaction. China has committed by treaty to preserve Hong Kong’s autonomy and its economic, political and social freedoms for 50
years from the July&nbsp;1, 1997 transfer of sovereignty from Great Britain to China. However, if China would exert its authority so as
to alter the economic, political or legal structures or the existing social policy of Hong Kong, investor and business confidence in Hong
Kong could be negatively affected, which in turn could negatively affect markets and business performance. In addition, the Hong Kong
dollar trades at a fixed exchange rate in relation to (or, is “pegged” to) the U.S. dollar, which has contributed to the growth
and stability of the Hong Kong economy. However, it is uncertain how long the currency peg will continue or what effect the establishment
of an alternative exchange rate system would have on the Hong Kong economy. Because each Fund’s NAV is denominated in U.S. dollars,
the establishment of an alternative exchange rate system could result in a decline in a Fund’s NAV. These and other factors could
have a negative impact on each Fund’s performance.</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0pt 0pt 40pt; text-align: justify"><i>Special Risk Considerations of Investing
in China.</i> For purposes of raising capital offshore on exchanges outside of China, including on U.S. exchanges, many Chinese-based
operating companies are structured as Variable Interest Entities (“VIEs”). In this structure, the Chinese-based operating
company is the VIE and establishes an entity, which is typically offshore in a foreign jurisdiction, such as the Cayman Islands. The offshore
entity lists on a foreign exchange and enters into contractual arrangements with the VIE. This structure allows Chinese companies in which
the government restricts foreign ownership to raise capital from foreign investors. While the offshore entity has no equity ownership
of the VIE, these contractual arrangements permit the offshore entity to consolidate the VIE’s financial statements with its own
for accounting purposes and provide for economic exposure to the performance of the underlying Chinese operating company. Therefore, an
investor in the listed offshore entity, such as the Fund, will have exposure to the Chinese-based operating company only through contractual
arrangements and has no ownership in the Chinese-based operating company. Furthermore, because the offshore entity only has specific rights
provided for in these service agreements with the VIE, its abilities to control the activities at the Chinese-based operating company
are limited and the operating company may engage in activities that negatively impact investment value. While the VIE structure has been
widely adopted, it is not formally recognized under Chinese law and therefore there is a risk that the Chinese government could prohibit
the existence of such structures or negatively impact the VIE’s contractual arrangements with the listed offshore entity by making
them invalid. If these contracts were found to be unenforceable under Chinese law, investors in the listed offshore entity, such as the
Fund, may suffer significant losses with little or no recourse available. If the Chinese government determines that the agreements establishing
the VIE structures do not comply with Chinese law and regulations, including those related to restrictions on foreign ownership, it could
subject a Chinese-based issuer to penalties, revocation of business and operating licenses, or forfeiture of ownership interest.</p>

for the acts of a corporation in which it invests for an amount greater than its actual investment in that corporation. Similarly, the
rights of investors in Middle Eastern issuers may be more limited than those of shareholders of a U.S. corporation. It may be difficult
or impossible to obtain or enforce a legal judgment in a Middle Eastern country. Some Middle Eastern countries prohibit or impose substantial
restrictions on investments in their capital markets, particularly their equity markets, by foreign entities such as a Fund. For example,
certain countries may require governmental approval prior to investment by foreign persons or limit the amount of investment by foreign
persons in a particular issuer. Certain Middle Eastern countries may also limit investment by foreign persons to only a specific class
of securities of an issuer that may have less advantageous terms (including price) than securities of the issuer available for purchase

not be possible on a timely basis. This may result in a delay during which a Fund may be denied certain of its rights as an investor,
including rights as to dividends or to be made aware of certain corporate actions. There also may be instances where a Fund places a purchase
order but is subsequently informed, at the time of re-registration, that the permissible allocation of the investment to foreign investors

is an emerging market and demonstrates significantly higher volatility from time to time in comparison to more developed markets. Political,
religious, and border disputes persist in India. India has recently experienced and may continue to experience civil unrest and hostilities
with certain of its neighboring countries, including Pakistan, and the Indian government has confronted separatist movements in several
Indian states, including Kashmir. Government control over the economy, currency fluctuations or blockage, and the risk of nationalization
or expropriation of assets offer higher potential for losses. Governmental actions could have a negative effect on the economic conditions
in India, which could adversely affect the value and liquidity of investments made by a Fund. The securities markets in India are comparatively
underdeveloped and with some exceptions, consist of a small number of listed companies with small market capitalization, greater price
volatility and substantially less liquidity than companies in more developed markets. Stockbrokers and other intermediaries in India may
not perform as well as their counterparts in the U.S. or other, more developed countries. The limited liquidity of the Indian securities
markets may also affect a Fund’s ability to acquire or dispose of securities at the price or time that it desires or the Fund’s
ability to track its index.</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0pt 0pt 20pt; text-align: justify">Global factors and foreign actions
may inhibit the flow of foreign capital on which India is dependent to sustain its growth. In addition, the Reserve Bank of India has
imposed limits on foreign ownership of Indian companies, which may decrease the liquidity of a Fund’s portfolio and result in extreme
volatility in the prices of Indian securities. In November 2016, the Indian government eliminated certain large denomination cash notes
as legal tender, causing uncertainty in certain financial markets. These factors, coupled with the lack of extensive accounting, auditing
and financial reporting standards and practices, as applicable in the U.S., may increase the risk of loss for a Fund.</p>

new and unsettled and, as a result, there is a risk of significant and unpredictable change in laws governing foreign investment, securities
regulation, title to securities and shareholder rights. Foreign investors in particular may be adversely affected by new or amended laws
and regulations. Certain Indian regulatory approvals, including approvals from the Securities and Exchange Board of India, the central
government and the tax authorities (to the extent that tax benefits need to be utilized), may be required before a Fund can make investments
in Indian companies. Capital gains from Indian securities may be subject to local taxation.</p>

in securities of issuers in certain African countries involve heightened risks including, among others, expropriation and/or nationalization
of assets, confiscatory taxation, political instability, including authoritarian and/or military involvement in governmental decision-making,
armed conflict, civil war, and social instability as a result of religious, ethnic and/or socio-economic unrest or widespread outbreaks
of disease and, in certain countries, genocidal warfare. Certain countries in Africa generally have less developed capital markets than
traditional emerging market countries, and, consequently, the risks of investing in foreign securities are magnified in such countries.
Because securities markets of countries in Africa are generally underdeveloped and are generally less correlated to global economic cycles
than those markets located in more developed countries, securities markets in African countries are subject to greater risks associated
with market volatility, lower market capitalization, lower trading volume, illiquidity, inflation, greater price fluctuations and uncertainty
regarding the existence of trading markets. Moreover, trading on African securities markets may be suspended altogether.</p>

by the actions of a small number of investors. Brokerage firms in certain countries in Africa may be fewer in number and less established
than brokerage firms in more developed markets. Since a Fund may need to effect securities transactions through these brokerage firms,
the Fund is subject to the risk that these brokerage firms will not be able to fulfill their obligations to the Fund (i.e., counterparty
risk). This risk is magnified to the extent that a Fund effects securities transactions through a single brokerage firm or a small number
of brokerage firms.</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0pt 0pt 20pt; text-align: justify">Certain governments in African countries
restrict or control to varying degrees the ability of foreign investors to invest in securities of issuers located or operating in those
countries. Moreover, certain countries in Africa require governmental approval or special licenses prior to investment by foreign investors
and may limit the amount of investment by foreign investors in a particular industry and/or issuer, and may limit such foreign investment
to a certain class of securities of an issuer that may have less advantageous rights than the classes available for purchase by domestic
investors of the countries and/or impose additional taxes on foreign investors. A delay in obtaining a government approval or a license
would delay investments in a particular country, and, as a result, a Fund may not be able to invest in certain securities while approval
is pending. The government of a particular country may also withdraw or decline to renew a license that enables a Fund to invest in such
country. These factors make investing in issuers located or operating in countries in Africa significantly riskier than investing in issuers
located or operating in more developed countries, and any one of these factors could cause a decline in the value of a Fund’s investments.
Issuers located or operating in countries in Africa are generally not subject to the same rules and regulations as issuers located or
operating in more developed countries. Therefore, there may be less financial and other information publicly available with regard to
issuers located or operating in countries in Africa and such issuers are generally not subject to the uniform accounting, auditing and
financial reporting standards applicable to issuers located or operating in more developed countries.</p>

threatened or imposed by a number of jurisdictions, including the United States, the European Union and the United Kingdom, and other
intergovernmental actions that have been or may be undertaken in the future, against Russia, Russian entities or Russian individuals,
may result in the devaluation of Russian currency, a downgrade in the country’s credit rating, an immediate freeze of Russian assets,
a decline in the value and liquidity of Russian securities, property or interests, and/or other adverse consequences to the Russian economy
or a Fund. The scope and scale of sanctions in place at a particular time may be expanded or otherwise modified in a way that have negative
effects on a Fund. Sanctions, or the threat of new or modified sanctions, could impair the ability of a Fund to buy, sell, hold, receive,
deliver or otherwise transact in certain affected securities or other investment instruments. Sanctions could also result in Russia taking
counter measures or other actions in response, which may further impair the value and liquidity of Russian securities. These sanctions,
and the resulting disruption of the Russian economy, may cause volatility in other regional and global markets and may negatively impact
the performance of various sectors and industries, as well as companies in other countries, which could have a negative effect on the
performance of a Fund, even if a Fund does not have direct exposure to securities of Russian issuers. As a collective result of the imposition
of sanctions, Russian government countermeasures and the impact that they have had on the trading markets for Russian securities, certain
Funds have used, and may in the future use, fair valuation procedures approved by the Fund’s Board to value certain Russian securities,
which could result in such securities being deemed to have a zero value. A reduction in liquidity of certain Fund holdings as a result
of sanctions and related actions may cause a Fund to experience increased premiums or discounts to its NAV and/or wider bid-ask spreads.
Additionally, if it becomes impracticable or unlawful for a Fund to hold securities subject to, or otherwise affected by, sanctions, or
if deemed appropriate by the Fund’s investment adviser, the Fund may prohibit in-kind deposits of the affected securities in connection
with creation transactions and instead require a cash deposit, which may also increase the Fund’s transaction costs.</p>

to repurchase agreements, a Fund may invest in short-term instruments, including money market instruments, on an ongoing basis to provide
liquidity or for other reasons. Money market instruments are generally short-term investments that may include but are not limited to:
(i) shares of money market funds; (ii) obligations issued or guaranteed by the U.S. government, its agencies or instrumentalities (including
government-sponsored enterprises); (iii) negotiable certificates of deposit (“CDs”), bankers’ acceptances, fixed time
deposits and other obligations of U.S. and foreign banks (including foreign branches) and similar institutions; (iv) commercial paper
rated at the date of purchase “Prime-1” by Moody’s or “A-1” by S&amp;P or, if unrated, of comparable quality
as determined by the Adviser; (v) non-convertible corporate debt securities (<i>e.g.</i>, bonds and debentures) with remaining maturities
at the date of purchase of not more than 397 days and that satisfy the rating requirements set forth in Rule 2a-7 under the 1940 Act;
and (vi) short-term U.S. dollar-denominated obligations of foreign banks (including U.S. branches) that, in the opinion of the Adviser
, are of comparable quality to obligations of U.S. banks which may be purchased by the Fund. Any of these instruments may be purchased
on a current or a forward-settled basis. Money market instruments also include shares of money market funds. Time deposits are non-negotiable
deposits maintained in banking institutions for specified periods of time at stated interest rates. Bankers’ acceptances are time
drafts drawn on commercial banks by borrowers, usually in connection with international transactions.</p>

may invest in the securities of real estate investment trusts (“REITs”) to the extent allowed by law. Risks associated with
investments in securities of REITs include decline in the value of real estate, risks related to general and local economic conditions,
overbuilding and increased competition, increases in property taxes and operating expenses, changes in zoning laws, casualty or condemnation
losses, variations in rental income, changes in neighborhood values, the appeal of properties to tenants, and increases in interest rates.
In addition, equity REITs may be affected by changes in the values of the underlying property owned by the trusts, while mortgage REITs
may be affected by the quality of credit extended. REITs are dependent upon management skills, may not be diversified and are subject
to the risks of financing projects. REITs are also subject to heavy cash-flow dependency, defaults by borrowers, self-liquidation and
the possibility of failing to qualify for the favorable United States federal income tax treatment generally available to REITs under
the Code, and failing to maintain exemption from the 1940 Act. If an issuer of debt securities collateralized by real estate defaults,
it is conceivable that the REITs could end up holding the underlying real estate.</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify"><b>REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS. </b>Each Fund may enter
into repurchase agreements with counterparties that are deemed to present acceptable credit risks. A repurchase agreement is a transaction
in which a Fund purchases securities or other obligations from a bank or securities dealer (or its affiliate) and simultaneously commits
to resell them to a counterparty at an agreed-upon date or upon demand and at a price reflecting a market rate of interest unrelated to
the coupon rate or maturity of the purchased obligations. A Fund maintains custody of the underlying obligations prior to their repurchase,
either through its regular custodian or through a special “tri-party” custodian or sub-custodian that maintains separate accounts
for both the Fund and its counterparty. Thus, the obligation of the counterparty to pay the repurchase price on the date agreed to or
upon demand is, in effect, secured by such obligations.</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">Repurchase agreements carry certain risks not
associated with direct investments in securities, including a possible decline in the market value of the underlying obligations. If their
value becomes less than the repurchase price, plus any agreed-upon additional amount, the counterparty must provide additional collateral
so that at all times the collateral is at least equal to the repurchase price plus any agreed- upon additional amount. The difference
between the total amount to be received upon repurchase of the obligations and the price that was paid by the Fund upon acquisition is
accrued as interest and included in its net investment income. Repurchase agreements involving obligations other than U.S. Government
securities (such as commercial paper and corporate bonds) may be subject to special risks and may not have the benefit of certain protections
in the event of the counterparty’s insolvency. If the seller or guarantor becomes insolvent, the Fund may suffer delays, costs and
possible losses in connection with the disposition of collateral.</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify"><b>REVERSE REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS. </b>The Funds
may enter into reverse repurchase agreements, which involve the sale of securities held by a Fund subject to its agreement to repurchase
the securities at an agreed-upon date or upon demand and at a price reflecting a market rate of interest. Reverse repurchase agreements
are subject to a Fund’s limitation on borrowings and may be entered into only with banks or securities dealers or their affiliates.
While a reverse repurchase agreement is outstanding, a Fund will maintain the segregation, either on its records or with the Trust’s
custodian, of cash or other liquid securities, marked-to-market daily, in an amount at least equal to its obligations under the reverse
repurchase agreement.</p>

that the buyer of the securities sold by a Fund might be unable to deliver them when that Fund seeks to repurchase. If the buyer of securities
under a reverse repurchase agreement files for bankruptcy or becomes insolvent, the buyer or trustee or receiver may receive an extension
of time to determine whether to enforce a Fund’s obligation to repurchase the securities, and the Fund’s use of the proceeds
of the reverse repurchase agreement may effectively be restricted pending such decision.</p>

portfolio securities to certain creditworthy borrowers, including the Fund’s securities lending agent. Loans of portfolio securities
provide a Fund with the opportunity to earn additional income on the Fund’s portfolio securities. All securities loans will be made
pursuant to agreements requiring the loans to be continuously secured by collateral in cash, or money market instruments, or money market
funds at least equal at all times to the market value of the loaned securities. The borrower pays to the Fund an amount equal to any dividends
or interest received on loaned securities. The Fund retains all or a portion of the interest received on investment of cash collateral
or receives a fee from the borrower. Lending portfolio securities involves risks of delay in recovery of the loaned securities or in some
cases loss of rights in the collateral should the borrower fail financially. Furthermore, because of the risks of delay in recovery, the
Fund may lose the opportunity to sell the securities at a desirable price. The Fund will generally not have the right to vote securities
while they are being loaned.</p>

carry the same credit support. Although many U.S. government securities in which the fund may invest, such as those issued by Fannie Mae
and Freddie Mac may be chartered or sponsored by Acts of Congress, their securities are neither issued nor guaranteed by the U.S. Treasury
and, therefore, are not backed by the full faith and credit of the United States. Some, such as those of Ginnie Mae, are supported by
the full faith and credit of the U.S. Treasury. Other obligations, such as those of the Federal Home Loan Banks, are supported by the
right of the issuer to borrow from the U.S. Treasury; and others are supported by the discretionary authority of the U.S. government to
purchase the agency’s obligations. Still others are supported only by the credit of the instrumentality or sponsored enterprise.
The maximum potential liability of the issuers of some U.S. government securities held by the fund may greatly exceed their current resources,
including their legal right to support from the U.S. Treasury. It is possible that these issuers will not have the funds to meet their
payment obligations in the future. No assurance can be given that the U.S. government would provide financial support to its agencies,

a percentage of gross domestic product has grown rapidly since the beginning of the 2008-2009 financial downturn and is expected to grow
even greater as a result of efforts to support the U.S. economy during the COVID-19 pandemic beginning in 2020.&nbsp; Although high debt
levels do not necessarily indicate or cause economic problems, they may create certain systemic risks if sound debt management practices
are not implemented.&nbsp; A high national debt can raise concerns that the U.S. government will not be able to make principal or interest
payments when they are due.&nbsp;&nbsp;This increase has also necessitated the need for the U.S. Congress to negotiate adjustments to
the statutory debt ceiling to increase the cap on the amount the U.S. government is permitted to borrow to meet its existing obligations
and finance current budget deficits. In August 2011, S&amp;P lowered its long term sovereign credit rating on the U.S. In explaining the
downgrade at that time, S&amp;P cited, among other reasons, controversy over raising the statutory debt ceiling and growth in public spending.
On August 2, 2019, following passage by Congress, the President of the United States signed the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2019, which suspends
the statutory debt limit through July 31, 2021. Any controversy or ongoing uncertainty regarding the statutory debt ceiling negotiations
may impact the U.S. long-term sovereign credit rating and may cause market uncertainty. As a result, market prices and yields of securities
supported by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government may be adversely affected. Increased government spending in response to
COVID-19 can cause the national debt to rise higher, which could heighten these associated risks.</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify"><i>Preferred stock</i> — Preferred stock
represents an equity interest in an issuer that generally entitles the holder to receive, in preference to common stockholders and the
holders of certain other stocks, dividends and a fixed share of the proceeds resulting from a liquidation of the issuer. Preferred stocks
may pay fixed or adjustable rates of return, and preferred stock dividends may be cumulative or non-cumulative and participating or non-participating.
Cumulative dividend provisions require all or a portion of prior unpaid dividends to be paid before dividends can be paid to the issuer’s
common stockholders, while prior unpaid dividends on non-cumulative preferred stock are forfeited. Participating preferred stock may be
entitled to a dividend exceeding the issuer’s declared dividend in certain cases, while non-participating preferred stock is entitled
only to the stipulated dividend. Preferred stock is subject to issuer-specific and market risks applicable generally to equity securities.
As with debt securities, the prices and yields of preferred stocks often move with changes in interest rates and the issuer’s credit
quality. Additionally, a company’s preferred stock typically pays dividends only after the company makes required payments to holders
of its bonds and other debt. Accordingly, the price of preferred stock will usually react more strongly than bonds and other debt to actual
or perceived changes in the issuing company’s financial condition or prospects. Preferred stock of smaller companies may be more
vulnerable to adverse developments than preferred stock of larger companies.</p>

security is generally entitled to participate in the capital appreciation resulting from a market price increase in the issuer’s
common stock and to receive interest paid or accrued until the convertible security matures or is redeemed, converted or exchanged. Before
conversion, convertible securities have characteristics similar to non-convertible debt or preferred securities, as applicable. Convertible
securities rank senior to common stock in an issuer’s capital structure and, therefore, normally entail less risk than the issuer’s
common stock. However, convertible securities may also be subordinate to any senior debt obligations of the issuer, and, therefore, an
issuer’s convertible securities may entail more risk than such senior debt obligations. Convertible securities usually offer lower
interest or dividend yields than non-convertible debt securities of similar credit quality because of the potential for capital appreciation.
In addition, convertible securities are often lower-rated securities. Because of the conversion feature, the price of a convertible security
will normally fluctuate in some proportion to changes in the price of the underlying asset, and, accordingly, convertible securities are
subject to risks relating to the activities of the issuer and/or general market and economic conditions. The income component of a convertible
security may cushion the security against declines in the price of the underlying asset but may also cause the price of the security to
fluctuate based upon changes in interest rates and the credit quality of the issuer. As with a straight fixed income security, the price
of a convertible security tends to increase when interest rates decline and decrease when interest rates rise. Like the price of a common
stock, the price of a convertible security also tends to increase as the price of the underlying stock rises and to decrease as the price
of the underlying stock declines.</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify"><i>Hybrid securities</i> — A hybrid security
is a type of security that also has equity and debt characteristics. Like equities, which have no final maturity, a hybrid security may
be perpetual. On the other hand, like debt securities, a hybrid security may be callable at the option of the issuer on a date specified
at issue. Additionally, like common equities, which may stop paying dividends at virtually any time without violating any contractual
terms or conditions, hybrids typically allow for issuers to withhold payment of interest until a later date or to suspend coupon payments
entirely without triggering an event of default. Hybrid securities are normally at the bottom of an issuer’s debt capital structure
because holders of an issuer’s hybrid securities are structurally subordinated to the issuer’s senior creditors. In bankruptcy,
hybrid security holders should only get paid after all senior creditors of the issuer have been paid but before any disbursements are
made to the issuer’s equity holders. Accordingly, hybrid securities may be more sensitive to economic changes than more senior debt
securities. Such securities may also be viewed as more equity-like by the market when the issuer or its parent company experiences financial
difficulties. Contingent convertible securities, which are also known as contingent capital securities, are a form of hybrid security
that are intended to either convert into equity or have their principal written down upon the occurrence of certain trigger events. One
type of contingent convertible security has characteristics designed to absorb losses, by providing that the liquidation value of the
security may be adjusted downward to below the original par value or written off entirely under certain circumstances. For instance, if
losses have eroded the issuer’s capital level below a specified threshold, the liquidation value of the security may be reduced
in whole or in part. The write-down of the security’s par value may occur automatically and would not entitle holders to institute
bankruptcy proceedings against the issuer. In addition, an automatic write-down could result in a reduced income rate if the dividend
or interest payment associated with the security is based on the security’s par value. Such securities may, but are not required
to, provide for circumstances under which the liquidation value of the security may be adjusted back up to par, such as an improvement
in capitalization or earnings. Another type of contingent convertible security provides for mandatory conversion of the security into
common shares of the issuer under certain circumstances. The mandatory conversion might relate, for example, to the issuer’s failure
to maintain a capital minimum. Since the common stock of the issuer may not pay a dividend, investors in such instruments could experience
reduced yields (or no yields at all) and conversion would deepen the subordination of the investor, effectively worsening the investor’s
standing in the case of the issuer’s insolvency. An automatic write-down or conversion event with respect to a contingent convertible
security will typically be triggered by a reduction in the issuer’s capital level, but may also be triggered by regulatory actions,
such as a change in regulatory capital requirements, or by other factors.</p>

those other fee based subscription services, including Authorized Participants (defined below), and to entities that publish and/or analyze
such information in connection with the process of purchasing or redeeming Creation Units or trading Shares of Funds in the secondary

of Shares are created and traded may raise certain issues under applicable securities laws. Because new Creation Unit Aggregations of
Shares are issued and sold on an ongoing basis, at any point a “distribution,” as such term is used in the Securities Act,
may occur. Broker-dealers and other persons are cautioned that some activities on their part may, depending on the circumstances, result
in their being deemed participants in a distribution in a manner which could render them statutory underwriters and subject them to the
prospectus delivery requirement and liability provisions of the Securities Act.</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">For example, a broker-dealer firm or its client
may be deemed a statutory underwriter if it takes Creation Unit Aggregations after placing an order with the Trust’s Distributor,
breaks them down into constituent Shares, and sells such Shares directly to customers, or if it chooses to couple the creation of a supply
of new Shares with an active selling effort involving solicitation of secondary market demand for Shares. A determination of whether one
is an underwriter for purposes of the Securities Act must take into account all the facts and circumstances pertaining to the activities
of the broker-dealer or its client in the particular case, and the examples mentioned above should not be considered a complete description
of all the activities that could lead to a categorization as an underwriter.</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">Broker-dealer firms should also note that dealers
who are not “underwriters” but are affecting transactions in Shares, whether or not participating in the distribution of Shares,
generally are required to deliver a prospectus. This is because the prospectus delivery exemption in Section 4(a)(3) of the Securities
Act is not available in respect of such transactions as a result of Section 24(d) of the 1940 Act. Firms that incur a prospectus delivery
obligation with respect to Shares of a Fund are reminded that, pursuant to Rule 153 under the Securities Act, a prospectus delivery obligation
under Section 5(b)(2) of the Securities Act owed to an exchange member in connection with the sale on the Listing Exchange is satisfied
by the fact that the prospectus is available at the Listing Exchange upon request. The prospectus delivery mechanism provided in Rule

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0"><b>&nbsp;</b></p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify"><b>Board Responsibilities.</b> The management
and affairs of the Trust and its series are overseen by a Board of Trustees. The Board elects the officers of the Trust who are responsible
for administering the day-to-day operations of the Trust and the Funds. The Board has approved contracts, as described below, under which
certain companies provide essential services to the Trust.</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify"><b>&nbsp;</b></p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">Like most ETFs, the day-to-day business of the
Trust, including the management of risk, is performed by third party service providers, such as the Adviser, the Distributor and the Trust’s
administrator. The Trustees are responsible for overseeing the Trust’s service providers and, thus, have oversight responsibility
with respect to risk management performed by those service providers. Risk management seeks to identify and address risks, <i>i.e.</i>,
events or circumstances that could have material adverse effects on the business, operations, shareholder services, investment performance
or reputation of the Funds. The Funds and their service providers employ a variety of processes, procedures and controls to identify various
of those possible events or circumstances, in an attempt to lessen the probability of their occurrence and/or to mitigate the effects
of such events or circumstances if they do occur. Each service provider is responsible for one or more discrete aspects of the Trust’s
business (<i>e.g.</i>, the Adviser is responsible for the day-to-day management of the Funds’ portfolio investments) and, consequently,
for managing the risks associated with that business. The Board has emphasized to the Funds’ service providers the importance of
maintaining vigorous risk management.</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">The Board’s role in risk oversight begins
before the inception of a Fund, at which time certain of the Fund’s service providers present the Board with information concerning
the investment objectives, strategies and risks of the Fund as well as proposed investment limitations for the Fund. Additionally, the
Adviser provides the Board with an overview of, among other things, its investment philosophy, brokerage practices and compliance infrastructure.
Thereafter, the Board continues its oversight function as various personnel, including the Trust’s Chief Compliance Officer, as
well as personnel of the Adviser, and other service providers such as the Fund’s independent accountants, make periodic reports
to the Audit Committee or to the Board with respect to various aspects of risk management. The Board and the Audit Committee oversee efforts
by management and service providers to manage risks to which a Fund may be exposed.</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">The Board is responsible for overseeing the nature,
extent, and quality of the services provided to the Funds by the Adviser and receives information about those services at its regular
meetings. In addition, on an annual basis (following the initial two-year period), in connection with its consideration of whether to
renew the Investment Advisory Agreement with the Adviser, the Board meets with the Adviser to review such services. Among other things,
the Board regularly considers the Adviser’s adherence to the Funds’ investment restrictions and compliance with various Fund
policies and procedures and with applicable securities regulations. The Board also reviews information about each Fund’s performance
and the Fund’s investments, including, for example, portfolio holdings schedules.</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">The Trust’s Chief Compliance Officer reports
regularly to the Board to review and discuss compliance issues and provide risk assessments. At least annually, the Trust’s Chief
Compliance Officer, provides the Board with a report reviewing the adequacy and effectiveness of the Trust’s policies and procedures
and those of its service providers, including the Adviser. The report addresses the operation of the policies and procedures of the Trust
and each service provider since the date of the last report; any material changes to the policies and procedures since the date of the
last report; any recommendations for material changes to the policies and procedures; and any material compliance matters since the date
of the last report.</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">The Board receives reports from the Funds’
service providers regarding operational risks and risks related to the valuation and liquidity of portfolio securities. Annually, the
independent registered public accounting firm reviews with the Audit Committee its audit of each Fund’s financial statements, focusing
on major areas of risk encountered by the Fund and noting any significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in the Fund’s internal
controls. Additionally, in connection with its oversight function, the Board oversees Fund management’s implementation of disclosure
controls and procedures, which are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Trust in its periodic reports with
the SEC are recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the required time periods. The Board also oversees the Trust’s
internal controls over financial reporting, which comprise policies and procedures designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding
the reliability of the Trust’s financial reporting and the preparation of the Trust’s financial statements.</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">From their review of these reports and discussions
with the Adviser, the Chief Compliance Officer, the independent registered public accounting firm and other service providers, the Board
and the Audit Committee learn in detail about the material risks of each Fund, thereby facilitating a dialogue about how management and
service providers identify and mitigate those risks.</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">The Board recognizes that not all risks that may
affect a Fund can be identified and/or quantified, that it may not be practical or cost- effective to eliminate or mitigate certain risks,
that it may be necessary to bear certain risks (such as investment-related risks) to achieve a Fund’s goals, and that the processes,
procedures and controls employed to address certain risks may be limited in their effectiveness. Moreover, reports received by the Trustees
as to risk management matters are typically summaries of the relevant information. Most of the Funds’ investment management and
business affairs are carried out by or through the Adviser and other service providers, each of which has an independent interest in risk
management but whose policies and the methods by which one or more risk management functions are carried out may differ from a Fund’s
and each other’s in the setting of priorities, the resources available or the effectiveness of relevant controls. As a result of
the foregoing and other factors, the Board’s ability to monitor and manage risk, as a practical matter, is subject to limitations.</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify"><b>Members of the Board and Officers of the Trust.
</b>There are [__] members of the Board of Trustees (each, a “Trustee”), [___] of whom are not interested persons of the Trust,
as that term is defined in the 1940 Act (“Independent Trustees”). [__________] serves as Chairman of the Board, and [__________]
serves as the Trust’s Lead Independent Trustee. The Board of Trustees is comprised of a super-majority (75 percent) of Independent
Trustees. There is an Audit Committee of the Board that is chaired by an Independent Trustee and comprised solely of Independent Trustees.
The Audit Committee chair presides at the Committee meetings, participates in formulating agendas for Committee meetings, and coordinates
with management to serve as a liaison between the Independent Trustees and management on matters within the scope of responsibilities
of the Committee as set forth in its Board-approved charter. The Trust has determined its leadership structure is appropriate given the
specific characteristics and circumstances of the Trust. The Trust made this determination in consideration of, among other things, the
number of Independent Trustees that constitute the Board, the amount of assets under management in the Trust, and the number of Funds
overseen by the Board. The Board also believes that its leadership structure facilitates the orderly and efficient flow of information
to the Independent Trustees from Fund management.</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify"><b>&nbsp;</b></p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">The Board of Trustees has two standing committees:
the Audit Committee and Nominating Committee. Each Committee is chaired by an Independent Trustee and composed of only Independent Trustees.</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">The Audit Committee is comprised of all of the
Independent Trustees. The function of the Audit Committee is to review the scope and results of the annual audit of the Funds and any
matters bearing on the audit or a Fund’s financial statements and to ensure the integrity of the Funds’ financial reporting.
The Audit Committee also recommends to the Board of Trustees the annual selection of the independent registered public accounting firm
for the Funds, and it reviews and pre-approves audit and certain non-audit services to be provided by the independent registered public
accounting firm. During the upcoming fiscal year the Audit Committee is expected to meet two times.</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">The Nominating Committee, comprised of all the
Independent Trustees, is responsible for seeking and reviewing candidates for consideration as nominees for Trustees. The Committee meets
on an as needed basis. During the upcoming year the Nominating Committee is not expected to meet.</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">Additionally, the Board of Trustees has appointed
the Adviser to make fair value determinations (“valuation designee”) in accordance with the Trust’s valuation policies
and procedures, subject to Board oversight. The Adviser has established a Fair Value and Valuation Committee that is comprised of representatives
from the Adviser’s compliance and operations teams. The Fair Value and Valuation Committee is responsible for valuing securities
held by the Funds for which current and reliable market quotations are not readily available. The Fair Value and Valuation Committee meets
as necessary and provides regular reporting to the Board.</p>

A potential conflict of interest may arise as a result of the portfolio managers’ management of a Fund and Other Accounts, which,
in theory, may allow them to allocate investment opportunities in a way that favors Other Accounts over a Fund. This conflict of interest
may be exacerbated to the extent that the Adviser or a portfolio manager receives, or expects to receive, greater compensation from their
management of the Other Accounts (some of which may receive a base and incentive fee) than from a Fund. Notwithstanding this theoretical
conflict of interest, it is the Adviser’s policy to manage each account based on its investment objectives and related restrictions,
and the Adviser has adopted policies and procedures reasonably designed to allocate investment opportunities on a fair and equitable basis
over time and in a manner consistent with each account’s investment objectives and related restrictions.</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0"><b>&nbsp;</b></p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">The policy of the Trust regarding purchases and
sales of securities for the Funds is that primary consideration will be given to obtaining the most favorable prices and efficient executions
of transactions. Consistent with this policy, when securities transactions are affected on a stock exchange, the Trust’s policy
is to pay commissions which are considered fair and reasonable without necessarily determining that the lowest possible commissions are
paid in all circumstances. The Trust believes that a requirement always to seek the lowest possible commission cost could impede effective
portfolio management and preclude the Funds from obtaining a high quality of brokerage and research services. In seeking to determine
the reasonableness of brokerage commissions paid in any transaction, the Adviser will rely upon its experience and knowledge regarding
commissions generally charged by various brokers and on its judgment in evaluating the brokerage services received from the broker effecting
the transaction. Such determinations are necessarily subjective and imprecise, as in most cases, an exact dollar value for those services
is not ascertainable. The Trust has adopted policies and procedures that prohibit the consideration of sales of Fund Shares as a factor
in the selection of a broker or dealer to execute its portfolio transactions.</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify"><b>&nbsp;</b></p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">The Adviser owes a fiduciary duty to its clients
to seek to provide best execution on trades effected. In selecting a broker/dealer for each specific transaction, the Adviser chooses
the broker/dealer deemed most capable of providing the services necessary to obtain the most favorable execution. “Best execution”
is generally understood to mean the most favorable cost or net proceeds reasonably obtainable under the circumstances. The full range
of brokerage services applicable to a particular transaction may be considered when making this judgment, which may include, but is not
limited to: liquidity, price, commission, timing, aggregated trades, capable floor brokers or traders, competent block trading coverage,
ability to position, capital strength and stability, reliable and accurate communications and settlement processing, use of automation,
knowledge of other buyers or sellers, arbitrage skills, administrative ability, underwriting and provision of information on a particular
security or market in which the transaction is to occur. The specific criteria will vary depending upon the nature of the transaction,
the market in which it is executed, and the extent to which it is possible to select from among multiple broker/dealers. The Adviser will
also use electronic crossing networks (“ECNs”) when appropriate.</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify"><b>&nbsp;</b></p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">Subject to the foregoing policies, brokers or
dealers selected to execute a Fund’s portfolio transactions may include the Fund’s Authorized Participants (as discussed in
“<u>Procedures for Purchase of Creation Units</u>” below) or their affiliates. An Authorized Participant or its affiliates
may be selected to execute a Fund’s portfolio transactions in conjunction with an all-cash creation unit order or an order including
“cash-in-lieu” (as described below under “Purchase and Redemption of Shares in Creation Units”), so long as such
selection is in keeping with the foregoing policies. As described below under “Purchase and Redemption of Shares in Creation Units—Creation
Transaction Fee” and “—Redemption Transaction Fee,” a Fund may determine to not charge a variable fee on certain
orders when the Adviser has determined that doing so is in the best interests of Fund shareholders, e.g., for creation orders that facilitate
the changes to a Fund’s portfolio in a more tax efficient manner than could be achieved without such order, even if the decision
to not charge a variable fee could be viewed as benefiting the Authorized Participant or its affiliate selected to executed the Fund’s
portfolio transactions in connection with such orders.</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify"><b>&nbsp;</b></p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">The Adviser may use a Fund’s assets for,
or participate in, third party soft dollar arrangements, in addition to receiving proprietary research from various full-service brokers,
the cost of which is bundled with the cost of the broker’s execution services. The Adviser does not “pay up” for the
value of any such proprietary research. Section 28(e) of the Exchange Act permits the Adviser, under certain circumstances, to cause a
Fund to pay a broker or dealer a commission for effecting a transaction in excess of the amount of commission another broker or dealer
would have charged for effecting the transaction in recognition of the value of brokerage and research services provided by the broker
or dealer. The Adviser may receive a variety of research services and information on many topics, which it can use in connection with
its management responsibilities with respect to the various accounts over which it exercises investment discretion or otherwise provides
investment advice. The research services may include qualifying order management systems, portfolio attribution and monitoring services
and computer software and access charges which are directly related to investment research. Accordingly, a Fund may pay a broker commission
higher than the lowest available commission in recognition of the broker’s provision of such services to the Adviser, but only if
the Adviser determines the total commission (including the soft dollar benefit) is comparable to the best commission rate that could be
expected to be received from other brokers. The amount of soft dollar benefits received depends on the amount of brokerage transactions
effected with the brokers. A conflict of interest exists because there is an incentive to: 1) cause clients to pay a higher commission
than the firm might otherwise be able to negotiate; 2) cause clients to engage in more securities transactions than would otherwise be
optimal; and 3) only recommend brokers that provide soft dollar benefits.</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">The Adviser faces a potential conflict of interest
when it uses client trades to obtain brokerage or research services. This conflict exists because the Adviser is able to use the brokerage
or research services to manage client accounts without paying cash for such services, which reduces the Adviser’s expenses to the
extent that the Adviser would have purchased such products had they not been provided by brokers. Section 28(e) permits the Adviser to
use brokerage or research services for the benefit of any account it manages. Certain accounts managed by the Adviser may generate soft
dollars used to purchase brokerage or research services that ultimately benefit other accounts managed by the Adviser, effectively cross
subsidizing the other accounts managed by the Adviser that benefit directly from the product. The Adviser may not necessarily use all
of the brokerage or research services in connection with managing a Fund whose trades generated the soft dollars used to purchase such
products.</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">The Adviser is responsible, subject to oversight
by the Board, for placing orders on behalf of the Funds for the purchase or sale of portfolio securities. If purchases or sales of portfolio
securities of a Fund and one or more other investment companies or clients supervised by the Adviser are considered at or about the same
time, transactions in such securities are allocated among the several investment companies and clients in a manner deemed equitable and
consistent with its fiduciary obligations to all by the Adviser. In some cases, this procedure could have a detrimental effect on the
price or volume of the security so far as a Fund is concerned. However, in other cases, it is possible that the ability to participate
in volume transactions and to negotiate lower brokerage commissions will be beneficial to the Funds. The primary consideration is prompt
execution of orders at the most favorable net price.</p>

paid to the affiliate by a Fund for exchange transactions not exceed “usual and customary” brokerage commissions. The rules
define “usual and customary” commissions to include amounts which are “reasonable and fair compared to the commission,
fee or other remuneration received or to be received by other brokers in connection with comparable transactions involving similar securities
being purchased or sold on a securities exchange during a comparable period of time.” The Trustees, including those who are not
“interested persons” of the Funds, have adopted procedures for evaluating the reasonableness of commissions paid to affiliates
and review these procedures periodically. As of the date of this SAI, the Funds have not paid brokerage commissions to any registered
broker-dealer affiliates of the Fund, the Adviser, or the Distributor.</p>

Trust’s portfolio transactions; (ii) engaged as principal in the largest dollar amounts of portfolio transactions of the Trust;

of an unlimited number of funds and Shares of each Fund. Each Share of each Fund represents an equal proportionate interest in any given
Fund with any given Share. Shares are entitled upon liquidation to a pro rata share in the net assets of the Funds. Shareholders have
no preemptive rights. The Declaration of Trust provides that the Trustees may create additional series or classes of shares. All consideration
received by the Trust for shares of any additional funds and all assets in which such consideration is invested would belong to that fund
and would be subject to the liabilities related thereto. Share certificates representing shares will not be issued. Each Fund’s
Shares, when issued, are fully paid and non-assessable.</p>

upon which a shareholder vote is required, consistent with the requirements of the 1940 Act and the rules promulgated thereunder. Shares
of all funds of the Trust vote together as a single class, except that if the matter being voted on affects only a particular fund it
will be voted on only by that fund and if a matter affects a particular fund differently from other funds, that fund will vote separately
on such matter. As a Delaware statutory trust, the Trust is not required, and does not intend, to hold annual meetings of shareholders.
Approval of shareholders will be sought, however, for certain changes in the operation of the Trust and for the election of Trustees under
certain circumstances. Upon the written request of shareholders owning at least 10% of the Trust’s shares, the Trust will call for
a meeting of shareholders to consider the removal of one or more Trustees and other certain matters. In the event that such a meeting
is requested, the Trust will provide appropriate assistance and information to the shareholders requesting the meeting.</p>

may maintain a derivative action on behalf of the Trust with respect to such Series (or class) unless holders of a least ten percent (10%)
of the outstanding Shares of such Series (or class) join in the bringing of such action. In addition to the requirements set forth in
Section 3816 of the Delaware Act, a Shareholder may bring a derivative action on behalf of the Trust with respect to a Series (or class)
only if the following conditions are met: (i) the Shareholder or Shareholders must make a pre-suit demand upon the Trustees to bring the
subject action unless an effort to cause the Trustees to bring such an action is not likely to succeed; and a demand on the Trustees shall
only be deemed not likely to succeed and therefore excused if a majority of the Trustees, or a majority of any committee established to
consider the merits of such action, has a personal financial interest in the transaction at issue, and a Trustee shall not be deemed interested
in a transaction or otherwise disqualified from ruling on the merits of a Shareholder demand by virtue of the fact that such Trustee receives
remuneration for his service as a Trustee of the Trust or as a trustee or director of one or more investment companies that are under
common management with or otherwise affiliated with the Trust; and (ii) unless a demand is not required under clause (i) of this paragraph,

Day” is any day on which the New York Stock Exchange and Trust are open for business.</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify"><b>Fund Deposits.</b> The consideration for purchase
of a Creation Unit of a Fund generally consists of the in-kind deposit of a designated portfolio of securities (the “Deposit Securities”)
per each Creation Unit and the Cash Component (defined below), computed as described below. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Trust reserves
the right to permit or require the substitution of a “cash in lieu” amount (“Deposit Cash”) to be added to the
Cash Component to replace any Deposit Security. When accepting purchases of Creation Units for all or a portion of Deposit Cash, a Fund
may incur additional costs associated with the acquisition of Deposit Securities that would otherwise be provided by an in-kind purchaser.</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify"><b>&nbsp;</b></p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">Together, the Deposit Securities or Deposit Cash,
as applicable, and the Cash Component constitute the “Fund Deposit,” which represents the minimum initial and subsequent investment
amount for a Creation Unit of a Fund. The “Cash Component” is an amount equal to the difference between the NAV of the Shares
(per Creation Unit) and the market value of the Deposit Securities or Deposit Cash, as applicable. If the Cash Component is a positive
number (<i>i.e.</i>, the net asset value per Creation Unit exceeds the market value of the Deposit Securities or Deposit Cash, as applicable),
the Cash Component shall be such positive amount. If the Cash Component is a negative number (<i>i.e.</i>, the net asset value per Creation
Unit is less than the market value of the Deposit Securities or Deposit Cash, as applicable), the Cash Component shall be such negative
amount and the creator will be entitled to receive cash in an amount equal to the Cash Component. The Cash Component serves the function
of compensating for any differences between the net asset value per Creation Unit and the market value of the Deposit Securities or Deposit
Cash, as applicable. Computation of the Cash Component excludes any stamp duty or other similar fees and expenses payable upon transfer
of beneficial ownership of the Deposit Securities, if applicable, which shall be the sole responsibility of the Authorized Participant
(as defined below).</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">The Funds, through NSCC, will make available on
each Business Day, prior to the opening of business on the Exchange (currently 9:30 a.m., Eastern Time), the list of the names and the
required number of Shares of each Deposit Security or the required amount of Deposit Cash, as applicable, to be included in the current
Fund Deposits (based on information at the end of the previous Business Day) for each Fund. Such Fund Deposits are subject to any applicable
adjustments as described below, to effect purchases of Creation Units of a Fund until such time as the next-announced composition of the
Deposit Securities or the required amount of Deposit Cash, as applicable, is made available.</p>

Securities or the amount of Deposit Cash, as applicable, required for a Fund Deposit for a Creation Unit changes as rebalancing adjustments
and corporate action events are reflected from time to time by the Adviser with a view to the investment objective of a Fund. The composition
of the Deposit Securities may also change in response to adjustments to the weighting or composition of the component securities of a
Fund’s Index. However, there will be no intraday changes to Deposit Securities or Deposit Cash except to correct errors in the published
list.</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">The Trust reserves the right to permit or require
the substitution of an amount of cash (that is a “cash in lieu” amount) to be added to the Cash Component to replace any Deposit
Security which may not be available in sufficient quantity for delivery or that may not be eligible for transfer through the systems of
DTC, the Clearing Process (discussed below), the Federal Reserve System for U.S. Treasury Securities (discussed below) or for other similar
reasons. The Trust also reserves the right to permit or require a “cash in lieu” amount where the delivery of Deposit Securities
by the Authorized Participant (as described below) would be restricted under the securities laws or where delivery of Deposit Securities
to the Authorized Participant would result in the disposition of Deposit Securities by the Authorized Participant becoming restricted
under the securities laws, and in certain other situations. The adjustments described above will reflect changes, known to the Adviser
on the date of announcement to be in effect by the time of delivery of the Fund Deposit, resulting from certain corporate actions.</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">On a given Business Day, the Trust may require
all Authorized Participants purchasing Creation Units on that day to deposit an amount of cash (that is a “cash in lieu” amount)
to replace any Deposit Security that may not be eligible for transfer through the systems of DTC or the Clearing Process (discussed below).
The Trust also reserves the right to permit a “cash in lieu” to replace any Deposit Security which may not be available in
sufficient quantity or which may not be eligible for trading by an Authorized Participant or the investor on whose behalf the Authorized
Participant is acting (“custom orders”). The Trust may in its discretion require an Authorized Participant to purchase Creation
Units of the Fund in cash, rather than in-kind. On a given Business Day, the Trust may announce before the open of trading that all purchases
of Creation Units of the Fund on that day will be made entirely in cash or, upon receiving a purchase order for Creation Units of the
Fund from an Authorized Participant, the Trust may determine to require that purchase to be made entirely in cash.</p>

To be eligible to place orders with the Distributor to purchase a Creation Unit of the Funds, an entity must be (i) a “Participating
Party”, <i>i.e.</i>, a broker-dealer or other participant in the clearing process through the Continuous Net Settlement System of
the NSCC (the “Clearing Process”), a clearing agency that is registered with the SEC; or (ii) a DTC Participant (see “BOOK
ENTRY ONLY SYSTEM”). In addition, each Participating Party or DTC Participant (each, an “Authorized Participant”) must
execute a Participant Agreement that has been agreed to by the Distributor, and that has been accepted by the Transfer Agent and the Trust,
with respect to purchases and redemptions of Creation Units. Each Authorized Participant will agree, pursuant to the terms of a Participant
Agreement, on behalf of itself or any investor on whose behalf it will act, to certain conditions, including that it will pay to the Trust,
an amount of cash sufficient to pay the Cash Component together with the creation transaction fee (described below) and any other applicable
fees and taxes.</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify"><b>&nbsp;</b></p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">All orders to purchase Shares directly from the
Funds must be placed for one or more Creation Units and in the manner and by the time set forth in the Participant Agreement and/or applicable
order form. The date on which an order to purchase Creation Units (or an order to redeem Creation Units, as set forth below) of such Funds
is received and accepted is referred to as the “Order Placement Date.”</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">The order cut-off time for orders to purchase
Creation Units for each Fund is expected to be 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time, which time may be modified by a Fund from time-to-time by amendment
to the Participant Agreement and/or applicable order form.</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">An Authorized Participant may require an investor
to make certain representations or enter into agreements with respect to the order, (<i>e.g.</i>, to provide for payments of cash, when
required). Investors should be aware that their particular broker may not have executed a Participant Agreement and that, therefore, orders
to purchase Shares directly from the Funds in Creation Units have to be placed by the investor’s broker through an Authorized Participant
that has executed a Participant Agreement. In such cases there may be additional charges to such investor. At any given time, there may
be only a limited number of broker-dealers that have executed a Participant Agreement and only a small number of such Authorized Participants
may have international capabilities.</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">On days when the Exchange closes earlier than
normal, the Funds may require orders to create Creation Units to be placed earlier in the day. In addition, if a market or markets on
which the Funds’ investments are primarily traded is closed, the Funds will also generally not accept orders on such day(s). Orders
must be transmitted by an Authorized Participant by telephone or other transmission method acceptable to the Distributor pursuant to procedures
set forth in the Participant Agreement and in accordance with the applicable order form. On behalf of the Funds, the Distributor will
notify the Custodian of such order. The Custodian will then provide such information to the appropriate local sub-custodian(s). Those
placing orders through an Authorized Participant should allow sufficient time to permit proper submission of the purchase order to the
Distributor by the cut-off time on such Business Day, as designated in the Participant Agreement. Economic or market disruptions or changes,
or telephone or other communication failure may impede the ability to reach the Distributor or an Authorized Participant.</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">Fund Deposits must be delivered by an Authorized
Participant through the Federal Reserve System (for cash) or through DTC (for corporate securities), through a sub-custody agent (for
foreign securities) and/or through such other arrangements allowed by the Trust or its agents. With respect to foreign Deposit Securities,
the Custodian shall cause the sub-custodian of the Funds to maintain an account into which the Authorized Participant shall deliver, on
behalf of itself or the party on whose behalf it is acting, such Deposit Securities (or Deposit Cash for all or a part of such securities,
as permitted or required), with any appropriate adjustments as advised by the Trust. Foreign Deposit Securities must be delivered to an
account maintained at the applicable local sub-custodian. The Fund Deposit transfer must be ordered by the Authorized Participant in a
timely fashion so as to ensure the delivery of the requisite number of Deposit Securities or Deposit Cash, as applicable, to the account
of a Fund or its agents by no later than 12:00 p.m. Eastern Time (or such other time as specified by the Trust) on the Settlement Date.
If a Fund or its agents do not receive all of the Deposit Securities, or the required Deposit Cash in lieu thereof, by such time, then
the order may be deemed rejected and the Authorized Participant shall be liable to a Fund for losses, if any, resulting therefrom. The
“Settlement Date” for the Funds is generally the second Business Day after the Order Placement Date. All questions as to the
number of Deposit Securities or Deposit Cash to be delivered, as applicable, and the validity, form and eligibility (including time of
receipt) for the deposit of any tendered securities or cash, as applicable, will be determined by the Trust, whose determination shall
be final and binding. The amount of cash represented by the Cash Component must be transferred directly to the Custodian through the Federal
Reserve Bank wire transfer system in a timely manner so as to be received by the Custodian no later than the Settlement Date. If the Cash
Component and the Deposit Securities or Deposit Cash, as applicable, are not received by the Custodian in a timely manner by the Settlement
Date, the creation order may be cancelled. Upon written notice to the Distributor, such canceled order may be resubmitted the following
Business Day using the Fund Deposit as newly constituted to reflect the then current NAV of a Fund.</p>

the day on which the purchase order is deemed received by the Distributor. Each Fund reserves the right to settle Creation Unit transactions
on a basis other than T+2, including a shorter settlement period, if necessary or appropriate under the circumstances and compliant with
applicable law. For example, each Fund reserves the right to settle Creation Unit transactions on a basis other than T+2 in order to accommodate
non-U.S. market holiday schedules, to account for different treatment among non-U.S. and U.S. markets of dividend record dates and ex-dividend
dates (i.e., the last day the holder of a security can sell the security and still receive dividends payable on the security) and in certain
other circumstances. The Authorized Participant shall be liable to a Fund for losses, if any, resulting from unsettled orders.</p>

of up to a maximum of 2% of the value of the Creation Units subject to the transaction may be imposed for cash purchases, non-standard
orders, or partial cash purchases of Creation Units. The variable charge is primarily designed to cover additional costs (<i>e.g.</i>,
brokerage, taxes) involved with buying the securities with cash. A Fund may determine to not charge a variable fee on certain orders when
the Adviser has determined that doing so is in the best interests of Fund shareholders, <i>e.g.</i>, for creation orders that facilitate
the rebalance of the Fund’s portfolio in a more tax efficient manner than could be achieved without such order. Investors who use
the services of a broker or other such intermediary may be charged a fee for such services. Investors are responsible for the fixed costs
of transferring the Fund Securities from the Fund to their account or on their order.</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify"><b>Risks of Purchasing Creation Units.</b> There
are certain legal risks unique to investors purchasing Creation Units directly from a Fund. Because Shares may be issued on an ongoing
basis, a “distribution” of Shares could be occurring at any time. Certain activities that a shareholder performs as a dealer
could, depending on the circumstances, result in the shareholder being deemed a participant in the distribution in a manner that could
render the shareholder a statutory underwriter and subject to the prospectus delivery and liability provisions of the Securities Act.
For example, a shareholder could be deemed a statutory underwriter if it purchases Creation Units from a Fund, breaks them down into the
constituent Shares, and sells those Shares directly to customers, or if a shareholder chooses to couple the creation of a supply of new
Shares with an active selling effort involving solicitation of secondary-market demand for Shares. Whether a person is an underwriter
depends upon all of the facts and circumstances pertaining to that person’s activities, and the examples mentioned here should not
be considered a complete description of all the activities that could cause you to be deemed an underwriter.</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">Dealers who are not “underwriters”
but are participating in a distribution (as opposed to engaging in ordinary secondary-market transactions), and thus dealing with Shares
as part of an “unsold allotment” within the meaning of Section 4(a)(3)(C) of the Securities Act, will be unable to take advantage
of the prospectus delivery exemption provided by Section 4(a)(3) of the Securities Act.</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify"><b>Redemption.</b> Shares may be redeemed only
in Creation Units at their net asset value next determined after receipt of a redemption request in proper form by the Funds through the
Transfer Agent and only on a Business Day. Redemption requests must be placed by or through an Authorized Participant. EXCEPT UPON LIQUIDATION
OF A FUND, THE TRUST WILL NOT REDEEM SHARES IN AMOUNTS LESS THAN CREATION UNITS. Investors must accumulate enough Shares in the secondary
market to constitute a Creation Unit to have such Shares redeemed by the Trust. There can be no assurance, however, that there will be
sufficient liquidity in the public trading market at any time to permit assembly of a Creation Unit. Investors should expect to incur
brokerage and other costs in connection with assembling a sufficient number of Shares to constitute a redeemable Creation Unit.</p>

proceeds for a Creation Unit will consist of Fund Securities -- as announced by the Custodian on the Business Day of the request for redemption
received in proper form plus cash in an amount equal to the difference between the net asset value of the Shares being redeemed, as next
determined after a receipt of a request in proper form, and the value of the Fund Securities (the “Cash Redemption Amount”),
less a fixed redemption transaction fee as set forth below. In the event that the Fund Securities have a value greater than the net asset
value of the Shares, a compensating cash payment equal to the differential is required to be made by or through an Authorized Participant
by the redeeming shareholder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at the Trust’s discretion, an Authorized Participant may receive the
corresponding cash value of the securities in lieu of the in-kind securities value representing one or more Fund Securities.</p>

of the number of Creation Units redeemed in the transaction are set forth in the table below. A Fund may adjust the redemption transaction
fee from time to time. The fixed redemption fee may be waived on certain orders if the Fund’s custodian has determined to waive
some or all of the Redemption Order Costs associated with the order or another party, such as the Adviser, has agreed to pay such fee.</p>

income tax consequences of investing in the Fund is based on the Code, U.S. Treasury regulations, and other applicable authority, all
as in effect as of the date of the filing of this SAI. These authorities are subject to change by legislative or administrative action,
possibly with retroactive effect. Tax reform legislation commonly known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “TCJA”) was enacted
on December 22, 2017. The Tax Act made significant changes to the U.S. federal income tax rules for individuals and corporations, generally
effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017. The application of certain provisions of the TCJA is uncertain, and the
changes in the act may have indirect effects on a Fund, its investments and its shareholders that cannot be predicted. The following discussion
is only a summary of some of the important U.S. federal income tax considerations generally applicable to investments in the Fund. There
may be other tax considerations applicable to particular shareholders. Shareholders should consult their own tax advisors regarding their
particular situation and the possible application of foreign, state, and local tax laws.</p>

issue regulations that would exclude foreign currency gains from the 90% test described in (a) above if such gains are not directly related
to a fund’s business of investing in stock or securities. Accordingly, regulations may be issued in the future that could treat

(i.e., ordinary REIT dividends other than capital gain dividends and portions of REIT dividends designated as qualified dividend income)
are treated as eligible for a 20% deduction by noncorporate taxpayers. This deduction, if allowed in full, equates to a maximum effective
tax rate of 29.6% (37% top rate applied to income after 20% deduction). The TCJA does not contain a provision permitting a RIC, such as
the Fund, to pass the special character of this income through to its shareholders. Currently, direct investors in REITs will enjoy the
deduction and, thus, the lower federal income tax rate, but investors in a RIC, such as certain of the Fund, that invest in such REITs
will not. It is uncertain whether a future technical corrections bill or regulations issued by the IRS will address this issue to enable
the Fund to pass through the special character of “qualified REIT dividends” to its shareholders.</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">If, for any taxable year, a Fund was to fail to
qualify as a RIC or was to fail to meet the distribution requirement, they would be taxed in the same manner as an ordinary corporation
and distributions to its shareholders would not be deductible by the Fund in computing its taxable income. In addition, a Fund’s
distributions, to the extent derived from the Fund’s current and accumulated earnings and profits, including any distributions of
net long-term capital gains, would be taxable to shareholders as ordinary dividend income for federal income tax purposes. However, such
dividends would be eligible, subject to any generally applicable limitations, (i) to be treated as qualified dividend income in the case
of shareholders taxed as individuals and (ii) for the dividends-received deduction in the case of corporate shareholders. Moreover, a
Fund would be required to pay out its earnings and profits accumulated in that year to qualify for treatment as a RIC in a subsequent
year. Under certain circumstances, a Fund may be able to cure a failure to qualify as a RIC, but to do so that Fund may incur significant
Fund-level taxes and may be forced to dispose of certain assets. If a Fund failed to qualify as a RIC for a period greater than two taxable
years, the Fund would generally be required to recognize any net built-in gains with respect to certain of its assets upon a disposition
of such assets within ten years of qualifying as a RIC in a subsequent year.</p>

at corporate rates, but the Fund may designate the retained amount as undistributed capital gains in a notice to its shareholders who
(i) will be required to include in income for federal income tax purposes, as long-term capital gain, their Shares of such undistributed
amount, (ii) will be deemed to have paid their proportionate Shares of the tax paid by the Fund on such undistributed amount against their
federal income tax liabilities, if any, and (iii) will be entitled to claim refunds on a properly filed U.S. tax return to the extent
the credit exceeds such liabilities. For federal income tax purposes, the tax basis of Shares owned by a shareholder of a Fund will be
increased by an amount equal to the difference between the amount of undistributed capital gains included in the shareholder’s gross
income and the tax deemed paid by the shareholder.</p>

tax on the undistributed amount. For these purposes, a Fund will be treated as having distributed any amount on which it has been subject
to corporate income tax for the taxable year ending within the calendar year. The Funds intend to declare and pay dividends and distributions
in the amounts and at the times necessary to avoid the application of the 4% excise tax, although there can be no assurance that they
will be able to do so. The Funds may in certain circumstances be required to liquidate Fund investments to make sufficient distributions
to avoid federal excise tax liability at a time when the investment adviser might not otherwise have chosen to do so, and liquidation
of investments in such circumstances may affect the ability of the Funds to satisfy the requirement for qualification as a RIC.</p>

wish to avoid purchasing Shares at a time when a Fund’s NAV reflects gains that are either unrealized, or realized but not distributed.

generally taxable as ordinary income. Taxes on distributions of capital gains are determined by how long a Fund owned the investments
that generated those gains, rather than how long a shareholder has owned his or her Fund Shares. Sales of assets held by a Fund for more
than one year generally result in long-term capital gains and losses, and sales of assets held by a Fund for one year or less generally
result in short-term capital gains and losses. Distributions from a Fund’s net capital gain (the excess of a Fund’s net long-term
capital gain over its net short-term capital loss) that are properly reported by a Fund as capital gain dividends (“Capital Gain
Dividends”) will be taxable as long-term capital gains. For individuals, long-term capital gains are currently subject to a reduced

other times result in such Fund’s receipt of cash in excess of the REIT’s earnings; if the Fund distributes these amounts,
these distributions could constitute a return of capital to Fund shareholders for federal income tax purposes. Dividends paid by a REIT,
other than capital gain distributions, will be taxable as ordinary income up to the amount of the REIT’s current and accumulated
earnings and profits. Capital gain dividends paid by a REIT to a Fund will be treated as long-term capital gains by such Fund and, in

to a maximum effective tax rate of 29.6% (37% top rate applied to income after 20% deduction). The Tax Act does not contain a provision
permitting a RIC, such as a Fund, to pass the special character of this income through to its shareholders. Currently, direct investors
in REITs will enjoy the lower rate, but investors in RICs that invest in such REITs will not. It is uncertain whether future technical
corrections or administrative guidance will address this issue to enable a Fund to pass through the special character of “qualified

When such reclassification is necessary, a Fund (or your broker) will send you a corrected, final Form 1099-DIV to reflect the reclassified

matures. If a Fund holds such debt instruments, it may be required to pay out as distributions each year an amount that is greater than

If a Fund invests in securities that have OID, it may be required to liquidate other investments, including at times when it is not advantageous
to do so, to satisfy its distribution requirements and to eliminate any possible taxation at the Fund level. Moreover, the Funds may realize
gains or losses from such liquidations. In the event a Fund realizes net gains from such transactions, its shareholders may receive larger

the Funds from sources within foreign countries and U.S. possessions (including, for example, dividends or interest on stock or securities
of non-U.S. issuers) may be subject to withholding and other taxes imposed by such countries and U.S. possessions that would reduce the
yield on a Fund’s stock or securities. Tax treaties between certain countries and the U.S. may reduce or eliminate such taxes in
some cases. Foreign countries generally do not impose taxes on capital gains with respect to investments by foreign investors.</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">If as of the end of the Funds’ taxable year
more than 50% of the value of a Fund’s assets consist of the securities of foreign corporations, the Fund may elect to permit shareholders
who are U.S. citizens, resident aliens, or U.S. corporations to claim a foreign tax credit or deduction (but not both) on their income
tax returns for their pro rata portions of qualified taxes paid by the Fund during that taxable year to foreign countries in respect of
foreign securities the Fund has held for at least the minimum period specified in the Code. In such a case, a Fund will treat those taxes
as dividends paid to its shareholders who must include in gross income from foreign sources their pro rata shares of such taxes and must
treat the amount so included as if the shareholder had paid the foreign tax directly. The shareholder may then either deduct the taxes
deemed paid by him or her in computing his or her taxable income or, alternatively, use the foregoing information in calculating any foreign
tax credit they may be entitled to use against the shareholders’ federal income tax. If the Fund makes the election, the Fund (or
its administrative agent) will report annually to its shareholders the respective amounts per share of the Fund’s income from sources
within, and taxes paid to, foreign countries and U.S. possessions. A shareholder’s ability to claim a foreign tax credit or deduction
in respect of foreign taxes paid by a Fund may be subject to certain limitations imposed by the Code, which may result in the shareholder
not getting a full credit or deduction for the amount of such taxes. Shareholders who do not itemize on their federal income tax returns
may claim a credit, but not a deduction, for such foreign taxes.</p>

entities, referred to as “passive foreign investment companies” or “PFICs,” the Fund will generally be subject
to one of the following special tax regimes: (i) the Fund may be liable for U.S. federal income tax, and an additional interest charge,
on a portion of any “excess distribution” from such foreign entity or any gain from the disposition of such shares, even if
the entire distribution or gain is paid out by the Fund as a dividend to its shareholders; (ii) if the Fund were able and elected to treat
a PFIC as a “qualified electing fund” or “QEF,” the Fund would be required each year to include in income, and
distribute to shareholders in accordance with the distribution requirements set forth above, the Fund’s pro rata share of the ordinary
earnings and net capital gains of the PFIC, whether or not such earnings or gains are distributed to the Fund; or (iii) the Fund may be
entitled to mark- to-market annually shares of the PFIC, and in such event would be required to distribute to shareholders any such mark-to-market
gains in accordance with the distribution requirements set forth above. In such instances, the Funds intend to make the appropriate tax
elections, if possible, and take any additional steps that are necessary to mitigate the effect of these rules.</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify"><b>Foreign Currency Transactions. </b>The Fund’s
transactions in foreign currencies and forward foreign currency contracts will generally be subject to special provisions of the Code
that, among other things, may affect the character of gains and losses realized by the Fund (<i>i.e.</i>, may affect whether gains or
losses are ordinary or capital), accelerate recognition of income to a Fund and defer losses. These rules could therefore affect the character,
amount and timing of distributions to shareholders. These provisions also may require the Fund to mark-to-market certain types of positions
in its portfolio (<i>i.e.</i>, treat them as if they were closed out) which may cause the Fund to recognize income without receiving cash
with which to make distributions in amounts necessary to satisfy the distribution requirements and for avoiding the excise tax described
above. The Fund intends to monitor its transactions, intends to make the appropriate tax elections, and intends to make the appropriate
entries in its books and records when it acquires any foreign currency or forward foreign currency contract in order to mitigate the effect
of these rules so as to prevent disqualification of a Fund as a RIC and minimize the imposition of income and excise taxes.</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">The U.S. Treasury Department has authority to
issue regulations that would exclude foreign currency gains from income that qualifies for the Fund to satisfy the RIC requirements of
the Code described above if such gains are not directly related to a Fund’s business of investing in stock or securities (or options
and futures with respect to stock or securities). Accordingly, regulations may be issued in the future that could treat some or all of
the Fund’s non-U.S. currency gains as non-qualifying income, thereby potentially jeopardizing the Fund’s status as a RIC for
all years to which the regulations are applicable.</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">An Authorized Participant having the U.S. dollar
as its functional currency for U.S. federal tax purposes that exchanges securities for Creation Units generally will recognize a gain
or loss equal to the difference between (i) the sum of the market value of the Creation Units at the time of the exchange and any amount
of cash received by the Authorized Participant in the exchange and (ii) the sum of the exchanger’s aggregate basis in the securities
surrendered and any amount of cash paid for such Creation Units. A person who redeems Creation Units will generally recognize a gain or
loss equal to the difference between the exchanger’s basis in the Creation Units and the sum of the aggregate U.S. dollar market
value of the securities plus the amount of any cash received for such Creation Units. The IRS, however, may assert that a loss that is
realized by an Authorized Participant upon an exchange of securities for Creation Units cannot be currently deducted under the rules governing
“wash sales,” or on the basis that there has been no significant change in economic position.</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify"><b>Master Limited Partnerships. </b>In general,
for purposes of the Qualifying Income Requirement described above, income derived from a partnership that is not a qualified publicly
traded partnership (as described below) will be treated as qualifying income only to the extent such income is attributable to items of
income of the partnership that would be qualifying income if realized directly by the Fund. While the rules are not entirely clear with
respect to an investment in a partnership outside a master-feeder structure, for purposes of testing whether the Fund satisfies the Diversification
Requirement, the Fund is generally treated as owning a pro rata share of the underlying assets of a partnership, including interests in
qualified publicly traded partnerships. As described below, the Fund’s investment in one or more of such qualified publicly traded
partnerships is limited under the Diversification Requirement to no more than 25% of the value of the Fund’s assets. However, 100%
of the net income derived from an interest in a “qualified publicly traded partnership” (generally, a partnership (i) interests
in which are traded on an established securities market or are readily tradable on a secondary market or the substantial equivalent thereof,
(ii) that derives at least 90% of its income from the passive income sources specified in the Internal Revenue Code section 7704(d), and
(iii) that derives less than 90% of its income from the same sources as described in the Qualifying Income Requirement) will be treated
as qualifying income. In addition, although in general the passive loss rules of the Internal Revenue Code do not apply to RICs, such
rules do apply to a RIC with respect to items attributable to an interest in a qualified publicly traded partnership.</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">MLPs taxed as partnerships have historically made
cash distributions to limited partners that exceed the amount of taxable income allocable to limited partners or members, due to a variety
of factors, including significant non-cash deductions such as depreciation and depletion. These excess cash distributions would not be
treated as income to the Fund but rather would be treated as a return of capital to the extent of the Fund’s basis in the MLP. As
a consequence, the Fund may make distributions that exceed its earnings and profits, which would be recharacterized as a return of capital
to shareholders. A return of capital distribution will generally not be taxable but will reduce each shareholder’s cost basis in
Shares and result in a higher capital gain or lower capital loss when the Shares are sold. After a shareholder’s basis in Shares
has been reduced to zero, distributions in excess of earnings and profits in respect of those Shares will be treated as gain from the
sale of the Shares.</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">The Fund may invest in certain MLPs which may
be treated as “qualified publicly traded partnerships” (as described above). Income from qualified publicly traded partnerships
is qualifying income for purposes of the Qualifying Income Requirement, but the Fund’s investment in one or more of such qualified
publicly traded partnerships is limited under the Diversification Requirement to no more than 25% of the value of the Fund’s assets.
The Fund will monitor its investment in such qualified publicly traded partnerships in order to ensure compliance with the Qualifying
Income and Diversification Requirements. MLPs and other partnerships that the Fund may invest in will deliver Form K-1s to the Fund to
report its share of income, gains, losses, deductions and credits of the MLP or other partnership. These Form K-1s may be delayed and
may not be received until after the time that the Fund issues its tax reporting statements. As a result, the Fund may at times find it
necessary to reclassify the amount and character of its distributions to you after it issues you your tax reporting statement.</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">The Fund may invest, directly or indirectly, in
entities that are taxed as corporations for United States federal income tax purposes, including certain MLPs that elect corporate treatment.
Distributions that the Fund receives from such corporations will generally be taxable to the extent of the corporations current or accumulated
earnings and profits. Distributions the Fund receives from such corporations in excess of current or accumulated earnings and profits
will generally not be taxable as a return of capital, but will reduce the Fund’s cost basis in the shares it owns and result in
a higher capital gain or lower capital loss when the Fund sells such shares. Certain corporations in which the Fund invests may accrue
deferred income taxes for their future tax liability associated with an underlying investment. Such deferred tax liabilities may affect
the value of the Fund’s investment in such entities.</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify"><b>Certain Reporting Regulations.</b> Under U.S.
Treasury regulations, if a shareholder recognizes a loss of $2 million or more for an individual shareholder or $10 million or more for
a corporate shareholder, the shareholder must file with the IRS a disclosure statement on Form 8886. Direct shareholders of portfolio
securities are in many cases excepted from this reporting requirement, but under current guidance, shareholders of a RIC are not excepted.
The fact that a loss is reportable under these regulations does not affect the legal determination of whether the taxpayer’s treatment
of the loss is proper. Shareholders should consult their tax advisors to determine the applicability of these regulations in light of
their individual circumstances.</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify"><b>Cost Basis.</b> Legislation passed by Congress
now requires the reporting of adjusted cost basis information for covered securities, which generally include Shares of a RIC acquired
to the IRS and to taxpayers. Shareholders should contact their financial intermediaries with respect to reporting of cost basis and available
elections for their accounts.</p>

tax discussion set forth above is for general information only. Shares of the Fund held in a tax-qualified retirement account will generally
not be subject to federal taxation on income and capital gains distributions from a Fund until a shareholder begins receiving payments
from their retirement account. Because each shareholder’s tax situation is different, prospective investors should consult their
tax advisors regarding the specific federal income tax consequences of purchasing, holding and disposing of Shares of the Funds, as well
as the effect of state, local and foreign tax law and any proposed tax law changes.</p>

law, distributions by a Fund to its shareholders and the ownership of Shares may be subject to state and local taxes. Rules of state and
local taxation of dividend and capital gains distributions from RICs often differ from the rules for federal income taxation described

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">Under the terms of the Delaware Statutory Trust Act
(“DSTA”) and the Registrant’s Agreement and Declaration of Trust (“Declaration of Trust”), no officer or

extent such limitation of liability is precluded by Delaware law, the Declaration of Trust or the By-Laws of the Registrant.</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">Subject to the standards and restrictions set forth
in the Declaration of Trust, DSTA, Section 3817, permits a statutory trust to indemnify and hold harmless any trustee, beneficial owner
or other person from and against any and all claims and demands whatsoever. DSTA, Section 3803 protects trustees, officers, managers and
other employees, when acting in such capacity, from liability to any person other than the Registrant or beneficial owner for any act,
omission or obligation of the Registrant or any trustee thereof, except as otherwise provided in the Declaration of Trust.</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">The Declaration of Trust provides that any person
who is or was a Trustee, officer, employee or other agent, including the underwriter, of such Trust shall be liable to the Trust and its
shareholders only for (1) any act or omission that constitutes a bad faith violation of the implied contractual covenant of good faith
and fair dealing, or (2) the person’s own willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence or reckless disregard of the duties involved
in the conduct of such person (such conduct referred to herein as Disqualifying Conduct) and for nothing else. Except in these instances
and to the fullest extent that limitations of liability of agents are permitted by the DSTA, these Agents (as defined in the Declaration
of Trust) shall not be responsible or liable for any act or omission of any other Agent of the Trust or any investment adviser or principal
underwriter. Moreover, except and to the extent provided in these instances, none of these Agents, when acting in their respective capacity
as such, shall be personally liable to any other person, other than such Trust or its shareholders, for any act, omission or obligation
of the Trust or any trustee thereof.</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">The Trust shall indemnify, out of its property, to
the fullest extent permitted under applicable law, any of the persons who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any
Proceeding (as defined in the Declaration of Trust) because the person is or was an Agent of such Trust. These persons shall be indemnified
against any Expenses (as defined in the Declaration of Trust), judgments, fines, settlements and other amounts actually and reasonably
incurred in connection with the Proceeding if the person acted in good faith or, in the case of a criminal proceeding, had no reasonable
cause to believe that the conduct was unlawful. The termination of any Proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction or plea of
nolo contendere or its equivalent shall not in itself create a presumption that the person did not act in good faith or that the person
had reasonable cause to believe that the person’s conduct was unlawful. There shall nonetheless be no indemnification for a person’s
own Disqualifying Conduct.</p>

<p style="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising
under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, may be permitted to Trustees, officers and controlling persons of the Registrant pursuant
to the foregoing provisions, or otherwise, the Registrant has been advised that in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission
such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Act and is, therefore, unenforceable. In the event that a claim for
indemnification against such liabilities (other than the payment by the Registrant of expenses incurred or paid by a Trustee, officer
or controlling person of the Registrant in the successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding) is asserted by such Trustee, officer
or controlling person in connection with securities being registered, the Registrant may be required, unless in the opinion of its counsel
the matter has been settled by controlling precedent, to submit to a court or appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such indemnification
is against public policy as expressed in the Act and will be governed by the final adjudication of such issue.</p>
