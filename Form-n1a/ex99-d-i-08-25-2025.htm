    <h1>CORGI ETF TRUST I</h1>
    <h2>INVESTMENT ADVISORY AGREEMENT</h2>
    <br />
    Corgi ETF Trust I, a Delaware statutory trust (the "Trust"), and Corgi
    Strategies, LLC, a Delaware limited-liability company (the "Adviser"),
    hereby enter into this investment advisory agreement, effective August 22
    2025, on behalf of each series identified on Schedule A (individually, a
    "Fund" and, collectively, the "Funds").<br />
    WHEREAS, the Trust is registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange
    Commission ("SEC") as an open-end management investment company under the
    Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the "1940 Act"), and may issue
    separate series of beneficial interests;<br />
    WHEREAS, the Adviser is, and will continue to be, registered as an
    investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (the "Advisers
    Act") and engages in the business of providing investment-management
    services;<br />
    WHEREAS, the Trust wishes to retain the Adviser to provide
    investment-management services to the Funds, and the Adviser is willing to
    furnish such services on the terms set forth herein;<br />
    NOW, THEREFORE, for and in consideration of the mutual promises set forth
    below, the parties stipulate and agree as follows:<br />
    <br />
    ARTICLE 1 - APPOINTMENT; DUTIES OF THE ADVISER<br />
    Section 1. Scope of Services.<br />
    The Adviser will develop and implement, on an ongoing basis, an investment
    management program for each Fund, exercising discretion to purchase, hold,
    lend, pledge or sell portfolio securities and other instruments; all subject
    to the supervision of the Trust's Board of Trustees (the "Board") and to
    each Fund's investment objectives, policies and restrictions as set forth in
    its registration statement and as the Board may amend from time to time.<br />
    Section 2. Compliance.<br />
    In performing its duties the Adviser shall comply with (a) the 1940 Act, the
    Advisers Act and all other federal and state laws and regulations applicable
    to the Trust and the Funds, (b) the Trust's Agreement and Declaration of
    Trust, By-laws, registration statement, and written policies or instructions
    of the Board, and (c) the listing standards of any exchange on which Fund
    shares are traded.<br />
    Section 3. Sub-Advisers.<br />
    Subject to Board approval and any required shareholder approval, the Adviser
    may engage one or more sub-advisers and shall oversee, compensate and remain
    fully responsible for any services so delegated.<br />
    Section 4. Personnel and Expenses (Unitary Fee).<br />
    The Adviser, at its own expense, shall furnish the personnel, office space,
    and equipment necessary to perform its obligations and shall pay, out of the
    advisory fee described in Article 3, all ordinary operating expenses of the
    Trust and each Fund except: (i) brokerage commissions and other
    transaction-related costs; (ii) taxes; (iii) interest on borrowings; (iv)
    acquired-fund fees and expenses; (v) distribution or service (12b-1) fees;
    (vi) litigation or other extraordinary expenses; and (vii) any expenses that
    the Board, by resolution, designates as being outside the scope of the
    unitary arrangement. This "unitary fee" structure is intended to centralize
    the payment of Fund expenses at the Adviser level, thereby efficiently
    directing cash flows from the Trust to the Adviser.<br />
    Section 5. Books and Records.<br />
    The Adviser shall maintain all records required by Rule 31a-1 and Rule 31a-2
    under the 1940 Act that are not otherwise maintained by the Trust's
    administrator, custodian or other service providers. All such records shall
    belong to the Trust, and the Adviser will deliver or make them available to
    the Trust on request and, in any event, upon termination of this
    Agreement.<br />
    <br />
    ARTICLE 2 - PORTFOLIO TRANSACTIONS<br />
    Section 1. Brokerage Selection.<br />
    The Adviser shall place all orders for the purchase and sale of portfolio
    securities for each Fund and shall seek to obtain overall best execution,
    taking into account price, execution quality, and other factors it deems
    material. In accordance with Section 28(e) of the Exchange Act, the Adviser
    may cause a Fund to pay a brokerage commission that exceeds the commission
    another broker might charge, provided it determines in good faith that such
    additional amount is fair in relation to the value of brokerage or research
    services received.<br />
    Section 2. Aggregation and Allocation.<br />
    Where the Adviser believes that combining orders will benefit a Fund,
    transactions may be aggregated with those for other clients and shall be
    allocated in a manner the Adviser considers equitable over time.<br />
    Section 3. Affiliated Brokers.<br />
    Transactions may be effected through brokers that are "affiliated persons"
    of the Adviser only in accordance with Rule 17e-1 under the 1940 Act and the
    Trust's compliance policies.<br />
    <br />
    ARTICLE 3 - ADVISORY FEE; UNITARY EXPENSE ARRANGEMENT<br />
    Section 1. Fee Rate.<br />
    For services rendered and expenses borne pursuant to Article 1, each Fund
    shall pay the Adviser a unitary advisory fee at the annual rate set forth
    opposite such Fund's name on Schedule A, calculated daily as a percentage of
    the Fund's average daily net assets and paid monthly in arrears.<br />
    Section 2. Accrual and Payment.<br />
    The fee accrues daily on a 365-day basis (366 days in leap years) and is
    payable to the Adviser within ten (10) business days after month-end. In the
    event this Agreement terminates before the end of a month, the fee shall be
    prorated through the date of termination. The Adviser may voluntarily waive
    or reduce any portion of its fee; any such waiver shall be treated as a
    contractual obligation for so long as it remains in effect.<br />
    <br />
    ARTICLE 4 - STATUS &amp; NON-EXCLUSIVITY<br />
    Section 1. Independent Contractor.<br />
    The Adviser acts hereunder as an independent contractor and, except as
    expressly authorised, has no authority to bind the Trust.<br />
    Section 2. Non-Exclusive Services.<br />
    Nothing herein prevents the Adviser or its affiliates from advising other
    clients, provided the Adviser's obligations to the Funds are not materially
    diminished.<br />
    <br />
    ARTICLE 5 - PERMISSIBLE INTERESTS<br />
    Trustees, officers, and shareholders of the Trust may own interests in the
    Adviser (and vice-versa). Such cross-holdings are permissible so long as
    they comply with the 1940 Act and the Trust's policies.<br />
    <br />
    ARTICLE 6 - LIABILITY AND INDEMNIFICATION<br />
    Section 1. Standard of Care.<br />
    The Adviser will exercise reasonable care and diligence but shall not be
    liable for losses unless caused by its willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross
    negligence, or reckless disregard of its obligations ("Disabling
    Conduct").<br />
    Section 2. Adviser Indemnification.<br />
    The Trust shall indemnify and hold harmless the Adviser and its affiliates
    from any claim, loss or expense ("Losses") arising out of the Adviser's
    activities under this Agreement, other than Losses resulting from the
    Adviser's Disabling Conduct.<br />
    Section 3. Trust Indemnification.<br />
    The Adviser shall indemnify and hold harmless the Trust, the Funds, their
    trustees and officers from any Losses arising out of (a) Disabling Conduct,
    or (b) any material misstatement or omission in Trust filings that is based
    on information provided by the Adviser.<br />
    <br />
    ARTICLE 7 - TERM AND TERMINATION<br />
    Section 1. Initial Term &amp; Renewal.<br />
    This Agreement takes effect on the date above and, with respect to each
    Fund, continues for an initial two-year term. Thereafter the Agreement
    renews annually subject to the approval requirements of Section 15(c) of the
    1940 Act.<br />
    Section 2. Termination by Either Party.<br />
    The Trust (by Board action or majority vote of the outstanding voting
    securities of a Fund) or the Adviser may terminate this Agreement as to any
    or all Funds on sixty (60) days' written notice without payment of
    penalty.<br />
    Section 3. Automatic Termination.<br />
    This Agreement shall terminate automatically in the event of its
    "assignment" (as defined in the 1940 Act) unless an exemption is
    obtained.<br />
    <br />
    ARTICLE 8 - AMENDMENTS<br />
    Any amendment or waiver of this Agreement must be in writing and executed by
    both parties; any 'material' amendment must also receive the approvals
    required under the 1940 Act.<br />
