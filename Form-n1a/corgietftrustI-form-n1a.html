        <br />
        The Founder-Led ETF (the "Fund") seeks to track the performance, before

        <br />
        <br />
        <b>Fees and Expenses of the Fund</b>
        <br />

        possible fees, such as your broker-dealer's brokerage commissions and

      <div align="LEFT">
        <b>Portfolio Turnover</b>
        <br />
        The Fund pays transaction costs, such as commissions, when it buys and
        sells securities (or "turns over" its portfolio). A higher portfolio
        turnover rate generally leads to higher trading costs and, in taxable
        accounts, may increase taxable distributions. These costs are not
        included in the total annual fund operating expenses or in the Example
        and reduce performance. Because the Fund is newly organized, portfolio
        turnover information is not yet available.
        <br />
      </div>

      <br />

      <div align="LEFT">
        <b>Principal Investment Strategies</b>
        <br />
        The Fund is an exchange-traded fund ("ETF") that uses a "passive
        management" (or indexing) approach to track the performance, before fees
        and expenses, of the Founder-Led Index (the "Index"). The Index tracks
        the performance of the top 50 founder-led publicly traded U.S.
        companies, defined as companies where at least one original founder
        currently holds a significant executive or c-suite title. The Index is
        owned and maintained by Corgi Strategies, LLC (the "Index Owner"), which
        is responsible for the selection criteria, constituent determination,
        and weighting methodology. Solactive AG (the "Index Calculator")
        calculates and disseminates the Index on behalf of Corgi Strategies,
        LLC.
      </div>

      <br />

      <div align="LEFT">
        <h3>The Index</h3>
        <b>I. Eligible Universe</b>
        <br />
        The Index's eligible universe includes common equity securities of
        U.S.-listed companies with primary listings only (excluding American
        Depositary Receipts and over-the-counter securities).
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>II. Constituent Selection</b>
        <br />
        Companies in the Index's eligible universe are first screened to
        identify founder-led companies, defined as companies where at least one
        original founder currently holds a significant executive or c-suite
        title. From this subset, the Index selects the top 50 companies based on
        float-adjusted market capitalization and liquidity screens.
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>III. Weighting</b>
        <br />
        Index constituents are assigned weights based on free float-adjusted
        market capitalization, subject to a maximum weight of 10% per issuer as
        of each Rebalance Day (defined below). If the Index becomes concentrated
        in a particular sector or industry, the Fund will generally reflect that
        concentration.
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>IV. Rebalancing</b>
        <br />
        The Index is reconstituted and rebalanced quarterly after the close on
        the third Friday of March, June, September, and December, effective the
        next trading day (each, a "Rebalance Day"). On each Rebalance Day, the
        10% single-issuer cap is applied.
        <br />
        <br />
        Between Rebalance Days, if any constituent's closing weight exceeds 20%,
        that constituent is reset to 10% and the excess weight is redistributed
        pro rata across the remaining constituents. This drift control can
        result in additional adjustments between scheduled Rebalance Days.
        <br />
      </div>

      <br />

      <div align="LEFT">
        <h3>The Fund's Investment Strategy</h3>
        The Fund seeks to achieve its investment objective by obtaining exposure
        to the Index primarily through (i) direct holdings of some or all of the
        equity securities included in the Index and/or (ii) the use of financial
        instruments (such as swap contracts) that provide economic exposure to
        one or more Index constituents. The Fund may also hold cash and
        short-term U.S. government securities (and/or other cash equivalents)
        for liquidity, collateral, and portfolio management purposes.
        <br />
        <br />
        Under normal circumstances, the Fund will be investing at least 80% of
        all its net assets, plus any borrowings for investment purposes, in
        equity securities of founder-led companies and/or financial instruments
        (such as swaps) that provide indirect exposure to founder-led companies.
        <br />
        <br />
        The Fund generally uses a replication approach, seeking to hold
        (directly or indirectly) each Index component in approximately the same
        weight as in the Index. When full replication is impracticable or
        inefficient (for example, due to liquidity, transaction costs, trading
        restrictions, or other considerations), the Fund may instead employ
        representative sampling by investing in a subset of securities and/or
        instruments with aggregate characteristics (including risk and return)
        similar to those of the Index as a whole.
        <br />
        <br />
        To the extent the Index concentrates in a particular industry or group
        of industries, the Fund will concentrate its investments to
        approximately the same extent.
        <br />
        <br />
        The Fund is classified as non-diversified under the Investment Company
        Act of 1940.
        <br />
      </div>

      <br />

      <div align="LEFT">
        <b>Principal Risks of Investing in the Fund</b>
        <br /><br />
        The principal risks are presented in alphabetical order to make
        comparison easier across funds. Each risk described below is considered
        a "principal risk" of investing in the Fund, regardless of its order. As
        with any investment, you could lose all or part of your investment. Any
        of these risks could adversely affect the Fund's net asset value
        ("NAV"), market price, yield, total return, and/or its ability to
        achieve its objective.
        <br /><br />

        <b>AP and Market Maker Dependence Risk.</b>
        The Fund relies on a limited number of authorized participants ("APs")
        and market makers to create, redeem, and provide liquidity in Shares. If
        these firms curtail or cease their activities and others do not step in,
        Shares may trade at significant premiums/discounts to NAV, experience
        wider bid-ask spreads, or be subject to trading halts or delisting.
        <br /><br />

        <b>Brokerage Commissions and Bid-Ask Spread Risk.</b>
        Investors transacting in the secondary market will pay brokerage
        commissions and may bear costs associated with the bid-ask spread. These
        costs tend to rise when trading volume is low or markets are stressed
        and can materially reduce investment results, especially for frequent or
        small transactions.
        <br /><br />

        <b>Concentration in Founder-Led Companies Risk.</b>
        Because the Index focuses on companies led by one or more original
        founders, the Fund's holdings may reflect governance practices,
        strategic choices, and corporate cultures that differ from peers. This
        thematic focus narrows the investable universe and may cause performance
        to differ—positively or negatively—from broader equity markets.
        <br /><br />

        <b>Control and Dual-Class Share Structures Risk.</b>
        Some founder-led issuers employ control mechanisms (e.g., dual-class
        voting) that concentrate voting power. Such structures can entrench
        management, reduce responsiveness to public shareholders, or amplify the
        market impact of founder-specific decisions or controversies.
        <br /><br />

        <b>Data and Index Calculation Risk.</b>
        The Index (and therefore the Fund) depends on third-party data and
        calculations. Errors, delays, or methodology misapplications—such as in
        classifying founder-led status, share counts, corporate actions, or
        float adjustments—may cause unintended inclusions/exclusions or
        inaccurate weights until corrected.
        <br /><br />

        <b>Equity Securities Risk.</b>
        Equity securities fluctuate in value due to issuer-specific events,
        sector dynamics, and broad market conditions. Common stocks generally
        exhibit greater volatility than preferred stocks or debt securities and
        may experience sudden declines or extended downturns.
        <br /><br />

        <b>Exchange Listing and Trading Risk.</b>
        Although Shares are expected to be listed on The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC
        (the "Exchange"), there is no assurance of active or liquid trading.
        Market volatility, trading halts, systems outages, or limited
        market-making activity may impair the ability to transact in Shares at
        or near NAV.
        <br /><br />

        <b>Geopolitical and Macro Events Risk.</b>
        Changes in interest and inflation rates, economic slowdowns,
        supply-chain disruptions, public-health events, natural disasters, armed
        conflict, sanctions, and other policy actions can increase volatility
        and negatively affect the Fund's investments and secondary-market
        trading.
        <br /><br />

        <b>Index Availability and Methodology Risk.</b>
        The calculation and dissemination of Index values can be delayed or
        interrupted if the calculation agent, data vendors, or a relevant stock
        exchange experiences a malfunction or outage. If index publication is
        interrupted due to data or systems issues, trading in Shares could be
        disrupted or halted. Mistakes in index data, calculations, or
        application of the methodology can occur and may not be promptly
        remedied, which can affect the Fund.
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>Index Ownership and Conflicts of Interest Risk.</b>
        The Adviser (or an affiliate) owns the Index intellectual property and
        licenses it to the Fund. Although the Adviser does not receive
        index-licensing revenue from the Fund, conflicts could arise in index
        rule design, constituent determinations, or timing of rebalances. The
        Trust maintains information-barrier policies and Board oversight;
        however, such measures may not fully eliminate perceived or actual
        conflicts.
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>Large-Capitalization Companies Risk.</b>
        Large-cap issuers can be slower to adapt to competitive or technological
        shifts and, in some environments, may underperform smaller companies
        that are more nimble.
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>New Fund Risk.</b>
        The Fund is newly organized and has limited or no operating history. It
        may take time to attract assets, build secondary-market liquidity, and
        achieve efficient index tracking.
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>Non-Diversified Fund Risk.</b>
        As a non-diversified fund under the Investment Company Act of 1940, the
        Fund may invest a larger portion of assets in fewer issuers than a
        diversified fund. Losses in a single issuer could have a proportionately
        greater adverse effect on the Fund's performance.
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>Operational and Cybersecurity Risk.</b>
        The Fund and its service providers rely on complex processes and
        technology. Human error, processing or communication failures, cyber
        incidents, or disruptions at counterparties and other third parties
        could impair operations, result in financial loss, or hinder the Fund's
        ability to meet its objective.
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>Passive Strategy Risk.</b>
        The Fund seeks to track the Index and does not take temporary defensive
        positions. Performance may deviate from broad market returns or active
        strategies; the Fund will not attempt to mitigate declines in the Index.
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>Premium/Discount to NAV Risk.</b>
        Shares trade at market prices that may be above (premium) or below
        (discount) NAV, particularly when market volatility is elevated, trading
        volume is limited, or the Index/portfolio experiences disruptions.
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>Rebalance and Intra-Quarter Drift Adjustment Risk.</b>
        The Index applies a 10% single-stock cap at each scheduled quarterly
        rebalance and may implement out-of-cycle adjustments if a constituent's
        weight exceeds a 20% drift threshold (resetting to 10% and
        redistributing the excess pro rata). These actions can increase
        turnover, transaction costs, and taxable gains, and may contribute to
        tracking difference.
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>Sector/Industry Focus Risk.</b>
        Founder-led issuers may cluster in particular sectors or industries. If
        the Index becomes concentrated in any sector(s), the Fund will reflect
        that concentration and may be more sensitive to sector-specific
        developments than a more diversified approach.
        <br /><br />

        <b>Succession and Key-Person Exposure Risk.</b>
        The departure, reduced role, or loss of influence of a company's founder
        or other key executive may adversely affect the issuer's prospects and,
        in some cases, its continued eligibility for the Index, potentially
        leading to removals at reconstitution and additional turnover.
        <br /><br />

        <b>Swap Agreements and Other Derivatives Risk.</b>
        To the extent the Fund uses derivatives (e.g., total return swaps) to
        obtain exposure or for portfolio management, it is subject to
        counterparty, liquidity, valuation, leverage, and correlation risks.
        Derivatives can be more volatile than direct holdings and may increase
        exposure to certain market risks.
        <br /><br />

        <b>Tracking Difference and Tracking Error Risk.</b>
        The Fund's results may differ from those of the Index for various
        reasons. The Fund bears operating expenses and portfolio transaction
        costs that the Index does not. The Fund may not be fully invested in
        Index constituents at all times, may hold securities not included in the
        Index, and may experience timing differences, cash holdings, corporate
        actions, tax considerations, or fair-value pricing that contribute to
        tracking difference.

        <b>Performance</b>
        <br />
        <br />
        Because the Fund has not completed a full calendar year of operations as
        of the date of this Prospectus, performance information is not
        presented. After the Fund has a full calendar year of results, this
        section will include a calendar-year bar chart and a table of average
        annual total returns, which will help illustrate the variability of
        returns over time and will compare the Fund's results with those of the
        Index and a broad-based securities market index. Past performance
        (before and after taxes) is not a guarantee of future results. Once
        available, updated performance information will be posted on the Fund's
        website at www.founderledfunds.com.

        <b>Management</b>
        <br />
        <br />
        Investment Adviser: Corgi Strategies LLC serves as investment adviser to
        the Fund.
        <br />
        <br />
        Portfolio Managers: The individual primarily responsible for the
        day-to-day management of the Fund is Henry B. Margulies, Portfolio
        Manager for the Adviser; who has been a portfolio manager of the Fund
        since its inception in 2025.

        <b>Purchase and Sale of Shares</b>
        <br />
        <br />
        The Fund issues and redeems shares only in large blocks called "Creation
        Units" at NAV next determined after an order is accepted. Only
        authorized participants ("APs") may transact in Creation Units directly
        with the Fund. Creation Units are generally issued and redeemed in
        exchange for a basket of securities and/or cash; the Fund may, in its
        discretion, permit or require all-cash creations or redemptions.
        <br />
        <br />
        Individual Shares are listed for trading on The Nasdaq Stock Market, LLC
        (the "Exchange") and may be bought or sold in the secondary market at
        market prices rather than at NAV. Market prices may be above (premium
        to) or below (discount to) NAV. Investors trading on an exchange will
        pay brokerage commissions and may be affected by the bid-ask spread.
        <br />
        <br />
        As available, information required by Rule 6c-11 (including the Fund's
        NAV, market price, historical premiums/discounts, and median bid-ask
        spread) will be posted on the Fund's website at www.founderledfunds.com.
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>Tax Information</b>
        <br />
        <br />
        Fund distributions are generally taxable to shareholders as ordinary
        income, qualified dividend income, and/or capital gains (or some
        combination), unless shares are held through an individual retirement
        account ("IRA") or other tax-advantaged arrangement, in which case taxes
        may be due upon withdrawal. Your tax treatment may vary; consult your
        tax adviser about your particular circumstances.
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>Financial Intermediary Compensation</b>
        <br />
        <br />
        If you purchase Shares through a financial intermediary (e.g., a
        broker-dealer or bank), the Adviser or its affiliates may, from their
        own resources, compensate the intermediary for activities related to the
        distribution, marketing, promotion, or sale of Shares, or for
        shareholder and educational support. These payments may create a
        conflict of interest by incentivizing the intermediary or its personnel
        to recommend the Fund over other investments. Such payments are not made
        by the Fund and do not increase the expenses paid by the Fund. Ask your
        salesperson or visit your intermediary's website for more information.

        <h3>ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT THE FUND</h3>
        <b>Investment Objective</b>
        <br />
        <br />
        The Founder-Led ETF (the "Fund") seeks to track the performance, before
        fees and expenses, of the Founder-Led Index (the "Index").
        <br />
        <br />
        An investment objective is fundamental if it cannot be changed without
        the approval of a "majority of the outstanding voting securities" (as
        defined in the Investment Company Act of 1940). The Fund's investment
        objective is not fundamental and may be changed by the Board of Trustees
        (the "Board") of Corgi ETF Trust I (the "Trust") upon 60 days' prior
        written notice to shareholders.
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>Principal Investment Strategies</b>
        <br />
        <br />
        The Fund's policy to invest, under normal market conditions, at least
        80% of its net assets (plus any borrowings for investment purposes) in
        equity securities of founder-led companies and/or in financial
        instruments that provide economic exposure to founder-led companies is
        non-fundamental and may be changed by the Board upon 60 days' prior
        written notice to shareholders.
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>The Index</b>
        <br />
        <br />
        The Index is owned by Corgi Strategies, LLC and licensed for use by the
        Fund. The Adviser does not receive index-licensing revenue from the
        Fund. Because the Adviser (or an affiliate) owns the Index IP, this
        "self-indexing" arrangement presents potential conflicts of interest;
        the Trust maintains information-barrier policies and procedures, and the
        Board provides oversight of index-related processes.
        <br /><br />
        Solactive AG ("Solactive") serves as the independent calculation agent
        and publisher of the Index.
        <br /><br />
        In summary, the Index screens U.S.-listed companies to identify
        founder-led issuers and selects the top 50 qualifying names by
        free-float market capitalization, subject to liquidity criteria.
        Constituents are weighted by free-float market capitalization, applying
        a 10% single-issuer cap on each Rebalance Day. Between Rebalance Days,
        if any constituent's closing weight exceeds 20%, it is reset to 10% and
        the excess weight is redistributed pro rata across the remaining
        constituents, subject to the methodology's constraints.
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>Rebalancing Schedule</b>
        <br />
        <br />
        The Index is reconstituted and rebalanced quarterly after the close on
        the third Friday of March, June, September, and December, with changes
        effective on the next trading day (each, a "Rebalance Day").
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>Manager of Managers Structure</b>
        <br />
        <br />
        The Fund does not currently employ a sub-adviser. The Adviser intends to
        seek exemptive relief from the SEC permitting the Adviser, subject to
        Board approval and applicable conditions, to appoint, replace, or
        materially amend agreements with unaffiliated sub-advisers without
        shareholder approval. Shareholders will be notified of any such changes
        as required. Any sub-advisory compensation will be paid by the Adviser
        and not by the Fund. The Adviser retains overall responsibility, under
        Board oversight, for supervising any sub-adviser(s), including
        selection, evaluation, and termination.

      <div align="LEFT">
        <b>Principal Risks of Investing in the Fund</b>
        <br />
        <br />
        The principal risks are presented in alphabetical order to facilitate
        finding particular risks and comparing them with those of other funds.
        Each risk summarized below is considered a "principal risk" of investing
        in the Fund, regardless of the order in which it appears. Investing
        involves risk, including the possible loss of principal. Any of the
        risks described can adversely affect the Fund's NAV, market price,
        income, or total return. Some or all of these risks may adversely affect
        the Fund's NAV per share price, yield, total return, and/or the Fund's
        ability to achieve its objective. The risks below could negatively
        affect the value of your investment in the Fund.
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>Equity Market Risk.</b> Common stocks generally carry more risk than
        preferred stock or debt because common shareholders are lower in the
        capital structure. Equity holdings may experience significant price
        volatility such as sharp, unexpected declines or extended downturns due
        to broad market conditions or developments specific to an issuer,
        industry, or sector held by the Fund.
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>ETF Risks.</b>
        <br />
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b
              >Authorized Participants, Market Makers, and Liquidity Providers
              Concentration Risk.</b
            >
            The Fund relies on a limited number of financial institutions that
            are authorized to purchase and redeem Creation Units directly with
            the Fund (each, an Authorized Participant or AP). There may also be
            a limited number of market makers and other liquidity providers
            active in Shares. If (i) APs exit the business, become unable to
            process creation and/or redemption orders, and no other APs step in,
            or (ii) market makers and/or other liquidity providers leave the
            market or materially scale back their activity and no replacements
            emerge, Shares may trade at a material discount to NAV and, in
            extreme cases, could face delisting.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <b>Costs of Buying or Selling Shares.</b> Investors who trade Shares
            in the secondary market will pay brokerage commissions or other
            charges set by their broker. Commissions are often fixed amounts and
            can be a significant proportional cost for investors transacting in
            small sizes. Secondary-market investors also bear the bid-ask
            spread. The spread varies over time with trading volume and market
            liquidity—generally narrower when trading volume and liquidity are
            higher and wider when they are lower. A relatively small investor
            base, sizable asset flows into or out of the Fund, and/or periods of
            elevated market volatility may widen spreads. Because commissions
            and spreads add to trading costs, frequent trading of Shares can
            materially reduce returns and may be inadvisable for investors who
            expect to make regular, small purchases or sales.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <b>Shares May Trade at Prices Other Than NAV.</b> As with all ETFs,
            Shares trade on an exchange at market prices that may differ from
            the Fund's NAV. At times, Shares may trade at an intraday premium
            (above NAV) or discount (below NAV) due to supply and demand for
            Shares or during volatile markets. This risk can be heightened in
            periods of market stress, sharp market declines, or when
            secondary-market trading activity in Shares is limited, in which
            case premiums or discounts may be significant.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <b>Trading.</b> Although Shares are listed for trading on The Nasdaq
            Stock Market, LLC (the “Exchange”) and may trade on other U.S.
            exchanges, there is no assurance that Shares will trade with active
            volume—or trade at all—on any exchange. In stressed market
            conditions, the liquidity of Shares and the liquidity of the Fund's
            portfolio holdings may deteriorate.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <b>General Market Risk.</b> Global economies and financial markets are
        increasingly interconnected, which raises the likelihood that events or
        conditions in one country or region will adversely affect markets or
        issuers elsewhere. Securities held by the Fund may underperform the
        broader markets, a particular market segment, or other asset classes due
        to factors that can include inflation (or expectations of inflation),
        interest-rate changes, shifts in global demand for products or
        resources, natural disasters or other major events, public-health
        emergencies, terrorism, regulatory developments, and governmental
        controls. controls.
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>Market Capitalization Risk.</b> Securities of large-capitalization
        companies may be relatively mature compared to smaller firms and
        therefore may exhibit slower growth during economic expansions.
        Large-capitalization companies may also be less agile in responding to
        new competitive challenges, including technological change and evolving
        consumer preferences.
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>Market Events Risk.</b> Financial markets can be volatile, and
        security prices can move substantially based on business cycles,
        interest-rate shifts, inflation or deflation views, perceived credit
        risk, and prevailing market liquidity, among other influences. In
        addition, the value of the Fund's investments may be negatively affected
        by the occurrence of global events. Global shocks, such as wars,
        terrorism, environmental or natural disasters, political instability,
        and epidemics or pandemics, as well as sanctions and trade restrictions
        (including those tied to recent conflicts in Eastern Europe and the
        Middle East) have increased market volatility and could continue to do
        so, affecting regional and global economies and certain securities.
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>Non-Diversification Risk.</b> Because the Fund is "non-diversified,"
        it may invest a greater percentage of its assets in the securities of a
        single issuer or a smaller number of issuers than if it were
        diversified. Consequently, weakness in one issuer or in a small group of
        issuers can have a proportionately larger impact on the Fund's value.
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>New Fund Risk.</b> The Fund is newly organized and has limited or no
        operating history. As a result, prospective investors do not have a
        performance record on which to base their investment decisions. The Fund
        may require time to attract assets, develop secondary-market liquidity,
        and achieve efficient index tracking.
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>Operational Risk.</b> The Fund is exposed to operational risks
        arising from people, processes, systems, and third parties. These risks
        include human mistakes; trade, settlement, or communication errors;
        failures or delays by service providers, counterparties, or other
        vendors; and breakdowns or outages in processes, technology, or other
        infrastructure. The Fund relies on external firms (e.g., custodian,
        transfer agent, administrator, pricing and data providers) for key
        functions, and difficulties engaging or retaining such providers, or
        disruptions in their services, could impair the Fund's operations and
        hinder achievement of its investment objective. The Fund and the Adviser
        maintain controls and procedures intended to manage operational risk,
        but no control environment can eliminate it entirely.
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>Passive Investment Risk.</b> The Fund is not actively managed and
        does not attempt to outperform its Index or take defensive positions in
        declining markets. As a result, the Fund's performance may be adversely
        affected by a general decline in the market segments relating to its
        Index. Because the Fund seeks to track its Index, its returns may lag
        other strategies or asset classes. Different categories of securities
        lead or lag at different times, sometimes for multi-year stretches, and
        the Fund will not take defensive positions to avoid such cycles.
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>Sector and Industry Risk.</b> If the Fund invests more heavily in
        particular sectors or industries, its results will be especially
        sensitive to events that significantly affect those areas. To the extent
        the Index becomes concentrated in one or more sectors or industries, the
        Fund will have similar exposure and could be negatively affected by
        adverse developments impacting those sectors or industries.
        <br />
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>Information Technology Sector Risk.</b> Companies in the
            information technology sector, and firms that rely heavily on
            technology, face fast product cycles, the risk of rapid
            obsolescence, evolving standards, and heightened regulation.
            Competition can be intense both domestically and internationally,
            including from lower-cost foreign competitors. Share prices of such
            companies, especially smaller or less-seasoned issuers, tend to be
            more volatile than the broader market. Many information technology
            companies depend on patents and other intellectual property; loss,
            impairment, or adverse enforcement of those rights (or allegations
            of infringement) could negatively affect their operating results and
            valuations. Supply-chain constraints, shortages of key inputs, and
            challenges attracting and retaining specialized talent may further
            pressure profitability.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <b>Third Party Data Risk.</b> The Index relies on information from
        third-party data vendors (e.g., prices, shares outstanding, free float,
        sector classifications, and corporate actions) and on calculations
        performed by an independent index calculator, Solactive AG (the "Index
        Calculator"). The Adviser (or an affiliate), as owner of the Index
        intellectual property, determines constituents and weights pursuant to
        the Index rules, including assessments of founder-led status based on
        public and other sources. Errors, delays, or misapplications by any
        party - data vendors, the Index Calculator, or the Adviser (or
        affiliate) - may result in unintended inclusions/exclusions, inaccurate
        weights, or delayed implementation of changes. Until corrected, such
        issues may cause the Fund to deviate from intended exposures and from
        the Index's published values.
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>Tracking Error Risk.</b> The Fund's results may differ from the Index
        because the Fund bears fees and trading costs the Index does not; at
        times the Fund may hold cash or positions not in the Index, or may not
        be fully invested in Index constituents.
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>Underlying Index Risk.</b> Neither the Fund's investment adviser nor
        the Index Calculator guarantees uninterrupted or timely index production
        or publication. Index values may be delayed by technology outages or
        other operational issues if the Index Owner, Index Calculator, data
        providers and/or relevant stock exchange malfunction for any reason.
        Disruptions at the calculation agent, data vendors, or an exchange may
        delay index values; prolonged interruptions could lead to trading halts
        in Shares. Data or methodological errors can occur and may not be
        corrected immediately by the Index Owner, Index Calculator, or other
        applicable party for a period of time or at all, which may have an
        adverse impact on the Fund and its shareholders.

        <br />
        <br />
        <b>Investment Adviser</b>
        <br />
        <br />
        Corgi Strategies, LLC (the "Adviser"), located at 473 Pine St, Floor 5,
        San Francisco, CA 94104, is a Delaware limited liability company seeking
        registration with the SEC as an investment adviser, and serves as
        investment adviser to the Fund. The Adviser was founded in July 2025,
        and as of [ ], 2025, has no prior assets under management and has not
        served as the investment adviser or sub-adviser for any other registered
        funds.
        <br />
        <br />
        The Adviser is responsible for overall portfolio management and
        administration of the Fund pursuant to an investment advisory agreement
        with Corgi ETF Trust I (the "Trust") (the "Advisory Agreement"). In
        addition to executing portfolio transactions, the Adviser may arrange
        for, and oversee, service providers performing transfer agency, custody,
        fund administration/accounting, distribution, and other services
        necessary for the Fund's operations.
        <br />
        <br />
        For its services to the Fund, the Fund pays the Adviser a unitary
        management fee, calculated daily and paid monthly, at an annual rate of
        0.49% of the Fund's average daily net assets. Under the Advisory
        Agreement, the Adviser pays substantially all of the Fund's expenses
        except for: the advisory fee itself; interest charges on borrowings;
        taxes; brokerage commissions and other expenses related to buying and
        selling portfolio investments; dividends and other expenses on
        securities sold short; acquired fund fees and expenses; any accrued
        deferred tax liability; distribution fees and expenses under any Rule
        12b-1 plan; litigation and other extraordinary expenses; and any other
        expenses the Fund is responsible for under the Advisory Agreement
        (collectively, the "Excluded Expenses").

        A discussion of the basis for the Board's approval of the Advisory
        Agreement will appear in the Fund's Annual Report to shareholders for
        the period ended [ ], 2026, on Form N-CSR.

        <br />
        <br />
        The individual primarily responsible for the day-to-day management of
        the Fund is Henry B. Margulies, Portfolio Manager, who has served in
        this role since 2025. Before his current role, Mr. Margulies oversaw
        technology investments at Wavemaker Partners, a venture capital firm
        based in Singapore. He has experience managing portfolios across a range
        of strategies and asset classes and has led teams through product
        launches and operational initiatives in the insurance and financial
        services technology sector.

        <b>HOW TO BUY AND SELL SHARES</b>
        <br />
        <br />
        The Fund issues and redeems Shares only in large blocks called "Creation
        Units," at the Fund's net asset value ("NAV") next determined after an
        order is accepted. Only authorized participants ("APs"), who must be
        members or participants of a registered clearing agency and must have an
        executed participant agreement with the Fund's distributor and transfer
        agent, may transact in Creation Units directly with the Fund. Once
        created, Shares may be bought and sold in the secondary market in
        amounts less than a Creation Unit.
        <br />
        <br />
        Most investors buy and sell Shares in secondary-market transactions
        through brokers. Shares are expected to be listed for trading on The
        Nasdaq Stock Market, LLC (the "Exchange") and can be bought and sold
        throughout the trading day at market prices. Investors may pay customary
        brokerage commissions and, because secondary-market transactions occur
        at market prices, investors may pay more than NAV when buying Shares and
        receive less than NAV when selling Shares.
        <br />
        <br />
        When you buy or sell Shares through a broker in the secondary market,
        you will pay customary brokerage commissions and charges. You may also
        bear some or all of the bid-ask spread on each purchase and sale.
        Because secondary-market trades occur at market prices, you may pay more
        than NAV when buying Shares and receive less than NAV when selling
        Shares.

      <div align="LEFT">
        <b>Book Entry</b>
        <br />
        <br />
        Shares are held only in book-entry form. The Depository Trust Company
        ("DTC") or its nominee is the record owner of all outstanding Shares.
        Beneficial ownership of Shares is shown on the records of DTC or its
        participants (e.g., brokers, banks, and other financial institutions).
        As a beneficial owner, you will not receive physical certificates and
        must rely on DTC and its participants to exercise rights associated with
        owning Shares, consistent with standard "street name" procedures.
        <br />
        <br />
        Shares are issued in book-entry form only; no stock certificates are
        provided. The Depository Trust Company ("DTC") or its nominee is the
        registered owner of all outstanding Shares. Investors hold Shares
        beneficially on the records of DTC or its participants (such as
        broker-dealers, banks, trust companies, clearing corporations, and other
        institutions that maintain custodial relationships with DTC). As a
        beneficial owner, you are not entitled to physical certificates or to
        have Shares registered in your name and are not considered a registered
        owner. Accordingly, you must rely on the procedures of DTC and its
        participants to exercise rights associated with owning Shares. These
        procedures are the same as those that apply to other securities you hold
        in "street name" through a brokerage account.

        <b>Frequent Purchases and Redemptions of Shares</b>
        <br />
        <br />
        The Fund does not impose restrictions on the frequency of purchases and
        redemptions of Shares. Purchases and redemptions by APs are integral to
        the ETF arbitrage mechanism and help keep market prices of Shares close
        to NAV. The Board has considered the potential for frequent purchases
        and redemptions, particularly for cash, to increase portfolio
        transaction costs, tracking difference, and realized capital gains, and
        has approved policies to mitigate these effects, including fair-value
        pricing and the imposition of transaction fees on Creation Unit
        purchases and redemptions designed to cover the Fund's costs. The Fund
        and the Adviser reserve the right to reject any purchase order at any
        time.

        <b>Determination of Net Asset Value</b>
        <br />
        <br />
        The Fund's NAV is calculated as of the close of regular trading on The
        Nasdaq Stock Market, LLC (normally 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time) on each day
        the Exchange is open for business. NAV is computed by dividing the
        Fund's net assets by the number of Shares outstanding.
        <br />
        <br />
        In determining NAV, portfolio securities and other assets are generally
        valued at market value using quotations, last sale prices, or values
        supplied by a pricing service or market makers. When such information is
        unavailable or is deemed unreliable, the affected investments are valued
        at fair value pursuant to the Fund's valuation procedures.

      <div align="LEFT">
        <b>Fair Value Pricing</b>
        <br />
        <br />
        The Board has designated the Adviser as the Fund's "valuation designee"
        under Rule 2a-5 of the 1940 Act, subject to the Board's oversight. The
        Adviser has adopted valuation policies and procedures to determine, in
        good faith, the fair value of investments for which market quotations
        are not readily available or are considered unreliable (for example,
        following a trading halt or when a primary pricing source fails to
        provide data). In making fair-value determinations, the Adviser may
        consider all reasonably available information deemed relevant, including
        issuer-specific data, market conditions, recent trading activity, and
        the circumstances that triggered the need for fair value. Because fair
        value determinations involve judgments, the prices assigned may differ
        from values realized upon sale.

        to the limits of Section 12(d)(1) of the 1940 Act and related rules.
        Other registered investment companies may invest in the Fund beyond the

        <br />
        <br />
        <b>Dividends and Distributions</b>
        <br />
        <br />
        The Fund intends to pay dividends and interest income, if any, annually,
        and to distribute any net realized capital gains to shareholders at
        least annually. The Fund will declare and pay income and capital gain
        distributions, if any, in cash. Cash distributions may be reinvested in
        additional whole Shares only if the broker through whom you hold Shares
        offers that option. Your broker is responsible for delivering any income
        and capital gain distributions to you.
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>Taxes</b>
        <br />
        <br />
        The following discussion summarizes certain U.S. federal income tax
        considerations that generally apply to investments in the Fund. Your
        situation may differ. You should consult your tax adviser regarding the
        tax consequences of investing in Shares, including the application of
        foreign, state, and local tax laws.
        <br />
        <br />
        The Fund intends to qualify each year as a regulated investment company
        ("RIC") under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the
        "Code"). If the Fund satisfies minimum distribution requirements, a RIC
        is generally not subject to fund-level federal income tax on income and
        gains that are timely distributed to shareholders. If the Fund were to
        fail to qualify as a RIC or fail to meet the distribution requirements
        (and no relief were available), it could be subject to fund-level
        taxation, which would reduce income available for distribution.
        <br />
        <br />
        Unless your Shares are held through a tax-exempt entity or
        tax-advantaged account (such as an IRA), you should consider potential
        tax consequences when the Fund makes distributions, when you sell Shares
        on the Exchange, and (for institutional investors only) when you
        purchase or redeem Creation Units.
        <br />
        <br />
        This general discussion is based on the Code and applicable Treasury
        regulations in effect on the date of this Prospectus. New legislation,
        administrative guidance, or court decisions may materially change these
        conclusions and may apply retroactively.
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>Taxes on Distributions</b>
        <br />
        <br />
        For federal income tax purposes, distributions of the Fund's net
        investment income are generally taxable to shareholders as ordinary
        income or as qualified dividend income. Tax treatment of distributions
        of net capital gains (if any) depends on how long the Fund held the
        investments that generated such gains, not on how long you have held
        your Shares. Sales of assets held by the Fund for more than one year
        generally produce long-term capital gains or losses; sales of assets
        held for one year or less generally produce short-term capital gains or
        losses. Distributions that the Fund reports as capital gain dividends
        ("Capital Gain Dividends") are taxable to shareholders as long-term
        capital gains. Distributions of short-term capital gains are generally
        taxable to shareholders as ordinary income. Dividends and distributions
        are generally taxable to you whether received in cash or reinvested in
        additional Shares.
        <br />
        <br />
        Distributions the Fund reports as "qualified dividend income" are
        generally taxed to non-corporate shareholders at the rates applicable to
        long-term capital gains, provided holding-period and other requirements
        are met. "Qualified dividend income" generally includes dividends from
        U.S. corporations and from certain qualified foreign corporations
        (including those incorporated in a U.S. possession, eligible for
        benefits under a comprehensive U.S. income tax treaty, or whose stock is
        readily tradable on an established U.S. market). Corporate shareholders
        may be eligible for a dividends-received deduction with respect to
        portions of dividends attributable to qualifying dividends the Fund
        receives from U.S. corporations, subject to applicable limitations.
        <br />
        <br />
        Shortly after the close of each calendar year, you will receive
        information describing the character of distributions you received from
        the Fund.
        <br />
        <br />
        In addition to federal income tax, certain individuals, trusts, and
        estates are subject to a 3.8% Net Investment Income ("NII") tax. This
        tax is imposed on the lesser of: (i) net investment income (as reduced
        by properly allocable deductions) or (ii) the excess of modified
        adjusted gross income over specified thresholds ($250,000 for married
        filing jointly, $200,000 for single filers, and $125,000 for married
        filing separately). The Fund's distributions and any capital gains
        realized on a sale or redemption of Shares are generally included in net
        investment income for purposes of the NII tax.
        <br />
        <br />
        In general, distributions are taxable to you in the year paid. However,
        some certain distributions paid in January may be treated as paid on
        December 31 of the year prior. In general, distributions are taxable
        even if they are paid from income or gains earned by the Fund before you
        purchased Shares (and thus were reflected in the Shares' NAV at the time
        of purchase).
        <br />
        <br />
        You may wish to avoid purchasing Shares shortly before a dividend or
        other distribution, because the distribution will generally be taxable
        to you even if it economically represents a return of a portion of your
        investment.
        <br />
        <br />
        If you are neither a U.S. citizen nor a U.S. resident (or are a foreign
        entity), distributions (other than Capital Gain Dividends) will
        generally be subject to U.S. withholding tax at a 30% rate, unless a
        lower treaty rate applies. Under certain circumstances, the Fund may
        report all or a portion of a dividend as an "interest-related dividend"
        or a "short-term capital gain dividend," which would generally be exempt
        from this 30% withholding tax, provided other requirements are met.
        <br />
        <br />
        The Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act ("FATCA") may require the Fund to
        withhold a 30% tax (generally not refundable) from distributions of net
        investment income made to: (A) certain foreign financial institutions
        that do not satisfy applicable FATCA reporting or compliance
        requirements that do not comply with FATCA reporting and due-diligence
        requirements (or that are not treated as compliant under an applicable
        intergovernmental agreement), and (B) certain non-financial foreign
        entities that do not provide required information regarding substantial
        U.S. owners. FATCA may also affect the Fund's returns on foreign
        investments or a shareholder's returns if Shares are held through a
        foreign intermediary. Consult your tax adviser regarding FATCA's
        application and any related certification, compliance, reporting, and
        withholding obligations.
        <br />
        <br />
        The Fund (or a financial intermediary, such as a broker, through which a
        shareholder holds Shares) is generally required to withhold and remit to
        the U.S. Treasury a portion of taxable distributions and sale or
        redemption proceeds if the shareholder fails to furnish a correct
        taxpayer identification number, has underreported certain interest or
        dividend income, or fails to certify that they are not subject to such
        withholding.
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>Taxes When Shares are Sold on the Exchange</b>
        <br />
        <br />
        Any capital gain or loss realized upon a sale of Shares generally is
        treated as long-term capital gain or loss if Shares have been held for
        more than one year, and as short-term capital gain or loss if Shares
        have been held for one year or less. However, a capital loss on Shares
        held six months or less is treated as long-term to the extent of Capital
        Gain Dividends received with respect to such Shares. Losses are
        disallowed to the extent you acquire (including through dividend
        reinvestment) substantially identical Shares within a 61-day period
        beginning 30 days before and ending 30 days after the sale.

        <br />
        An authorized participant ("AP") whose functional currency is the U.S.
        dollar and who exchanges securities for Creation Units generally
        recognizes gain or loss equal to the difference between (i) the value of
        the Creation Units at the time of the exchange and (ii) the AP's
        aggregate basis in the securities delivered plus any cash paid. An AP
        that exchanges Creation Units for securities will generally recognize
        gain or loss equal to the difference between (i) the AP's basis in the
        Creation Units and (ii) the aggregate U.S. dollar market value of the
        securities received plus any cash received. The IRS may assert that a
        loss realized upon an exchange of securities for Creation Units is not
        currently deductible (e.g., under the "wash sale" rules for an AP not
        marking to market, or on the theory that there was no significant change
        in economic position). APs should consult their own tax advisers about
        the application of wash sale rules and the timing of any loss
        deductions.
        <br />
        <br />
        Any capital gain or loss realized upon redemption of Creation Units is
        generally treated as long-term capital gain or loss if the Shares
        comprising the Creation Units were held for more than one year, and as
        short-term capital gain or loss if held for one year or less.
        <br />
        <br />
        The Fund may include a payment of cash in addition to, or in place of,
        delivering a basket of securities when redeeming Creation Units. To
        raise cash for such redemptions, the Fund may sell portfolio securities,
        potentially recognizing investment income and/or capital gains or losses
        it might not have recognized if the redemption had been satisfied
        entirely in kind. As a result, including cash in redemption proceeds can
        reduce the Fund's tax efficiency.
        <br />
        <br />
        The foregoing discussion summarizes some possible consequences under
        current federal tax law of investing in the Fund. It is not a substitute
        for personal tax advice. You may also be subject to foreign, state, and
        local taxes on Fund distributions and on sales of Shares. Consult your
        tax adviser regarding the tax consequences of investing in Shares under
        all applicable laws. For additional information, see "Federal Income
        Taxes" in the SAI.

        <b>DISTRIBUTION</b>
        <br />
        <br />
        [ ] (the "Distributor"), the Fund's distributor, is a broker-dealer
        registered with the SEC, serves as the Fund's distributor for Creation
        Units on an agency basis and does not make a secondary market in Shares.
        The Distributor does not set Fund policies or select the portfolio
        securities of the Fund. The Distributor's principal address is [ ].
        <br />
        <br />
        The Board has adopted a Distribution (Rule 12b-1) Plan (the "Plan")
        pursuant to Rule 12b-1 under the 1940 Act. Under the Plan, the Fund is
        authorized to pay up to [0.25]% of its average daily net assets each
        year for distribution-related services in connection with the sale and
        distribution of its Shares.
        <br />
        <br />
        The Fund does not currently pay Rule 12b-1 fees and there are no current
        plans to impose such fees. If Rule 12b-1 fees are charged in the future,
        because they are paid from Fund assets on an ongoing basis, these fees
        would increase the cost of your investment over time and may exceed
        certain other types of sales charges.

        <b>ADDITIONAL NOTICES</b>
        <br />
        <br />
        Shares are not sponsored, endorsed, or promoted by the Exchange. The
        Exchange is not responsible for, and has not participated in, the
        determination of the timing, prices, or quantities of Shares to be
        issued, nor in the determination or calculation of any equation by which
        to determine redeemability of Shares. The Exchange has no duty or
        liability to shareholders for the administration, marketing, or trading
        of the Shares.
        <br />
        <br />
        Without limiting the foregoing, in no event shall the Exchange have any
        liability for lost profits or for indirect, punitive, special, or
        consequential damages, even if advised of the possibility of such
        damages.
        <br />
        <br />
        The Adviser and the Fund make no representation or warranty, express or
        implied, to owners of Shares or to the public regarding the advisability
        of investing in securities generally or in the Fund specifically.
        <br />
        <br />
        The Agreement and Declaration of Trust (the "Declaration of Trust") sets
        forth a detailed process for shareholders to bring derivative or direct
        actions, designed to permit legitimate claims while limiting the costs,
        distraction, and other harm that can result from spurious demands and
        derivative actions. Before bringing a derivative action, a demand by
        three unrelated shareholders must be made to the Fund's Trustees. The
        Declaration of Trust specifies required information, certifications,
        undertakings, and acknowledgments that must accompany such a demand.
        Upon receiving a demand, the Trustees have 90 days—extendable by an
        additional 60 days—to consider it. If a majority of the Trustees who are
        independent for purposes of considering the demand determine that
        pursuing the requested action is not in the best interests of the Fund,
        they must reject the demand, and the complaining shareholders may not
        proceed with a derivative action unless they can demonstrate to a court
        that the Trustees' decision was not a good-faith exercise of business
        judgment on the Fund's behalf. In addition, shareholders owning Shares
        representing no less than a majority of the Fund's outstanding shares
        must join in bringing any derivative action. If a demand is rejected,
        the complaining shareholders may be responsible for the Fund's costs and
        expenses (including attorneys' fees) incurred in considering the demand
        if a court determines that the demand was made without reasonable cause
        or for an improper purpose. If a derivative action is brought in
        violation of the Declaration of Trust, the shareholders bringing the
        action may be responsible for the Fund's costs, including attorneys'
        fees, if a court determines that the action was brought without
        reasonable cause or for an improper purpose. The Declaration of Trust
        provides that no shareholder may bring a direct action alleging injury
        as a shareholder of the Trust or any Fund where the matters alleged
        would, if true, give rise to a claim belonging to the Trust (or the
        Trust on behalf of the Fund), unless the shareholder has suffered a harm
        distinct from that of other shareholders. A shareholder bringing a
        direct claim must be a shareholder of the Fund at the time of the
        alleged injury or must have acquired the shares by operation of law from
        a person who was also a shareholder as of that time. The Declaration of
        Trust further provides that the Fund will pay attorneys' fees and legal
        expenses incurred by a complaining shareholder only if required by law,
        and any attorneys' fees the Fund is obligated to pay will be calculated
        using reasonable hourly rates. These provisions do not apply to claims
        brought under the federal securities laws.
        <br />
        <br />
        The Declaration of Trust provides that shareholder actions against the
        Fund must be filed exclusively in state or federal courts located in
        Delaware. This forum provision does not apply to claims under the
        federal securities laws. Limiting actions to courts in Delaware may
        impose economic hardship on shareholders (e.g., travel costs, the need
        to retain local counsel) and may limit access to a forum some
        shareholders would otherwise prefer, which could discourage such
        actions.

        <h3>GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT THE TRUST</h3>
        <br />
        The Trust is an open-end management investment company consisting of
        multiple series, including the Founder-Led ETF and the Founder-Led 2x
        Daily ETF (each, a "Fund"). This SAI relates to the Funds. The Trust is
        a Delaware statutory trust formed on: July 15, 2025. The Trust is
        registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC")
        under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (together with the
        rules and regulations thereunder, the "1940 Act"), as an open-end
        management investment company, and the offering of Shares is registered
        under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"). The
        Trust is governed by its Board of Trustees (the "Board"). The
        Founder-Led ETF seeks to track the performance, before fees and
        expenses, of the Founder-Led Index (the "Index"). The Founder-Led 2x
        Daily ETF seeks daily investment results, before fees and expenses, that
        correspond to 200% of the Index's daily performance. Corgi Strategies,
        LLC (the "Adviser") serves as investment adviser to the Funds.
        <br />
        <br />
        Each Fund offers and issues Shares at their net asset value ("NAV") only
        in aggregations of a specified number of Shares (each, a "Creation
        Unit"). A Fund generally issues and redeems Creation Units in exchange
        for a basket of securities ("Deposit Securities") together with a
        specified cash payment (the "Cash Component"). The Trust may permit or
        require the substitution of a cash amount ("Deposit Cash") in lieu of
        some or all Deposit Securities. Shares are expected to be listed on The
        Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (the "Exchange") and trade on the Exchange at
        market prices, which may differ from NAV. Shares are redeemable only in
        Creation Unit aggregations and, in general, in exchange for portfolio
        securities and a specified cash payment, or instead, entirely for cash.
        As a practical matter, mostly only institutions or large investors,
        known as "Authorized Participants" or "APs," purchase or redeem Creation
        Units. Except when aggregated in Creation Units, Shares are not
        individually redeemable.
        <br />
        <br />
        Shares may be issued in advance of receipt of some or all Deposit
        Securities, subject to conditions set forth in the participant agreement
        with the distributor and transfer agent (the "Participant Agreement"),
        including a requirement to maintain with the Trust cash at least equal
        to a specified percentage of the value of any missing Deposit
        Securities. The Trust may impose a transaction fee on each creation or
        redemption. In all cases, such fees will be limited in accordance with
        SEC requirements applicable to management investment companies offering
        redeemable securities. As with other publicly traded securities,
        brokers' commissions on secondary-market transactions are negotiated
        with your broker at customary rates.

        <h3>
          ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT INVESTMENT OBJECTIVES, POLICIES, AND
          RELATED RISKS
        </h3>
        The Funds' investment objectives and principal investment strategies are
        described in the Prospectuses under "Investment Objective" and
        "Principal Investment Strategies," respectively. The information below
        supplements, and should be read together with, the Prospectuses. For a
        description of certain permitted investments, see "Description of
        Permitted Investments" in this SAI.
        <br />
        <br />
        With respect to the Funds' investments, unless otherwise noted, if a
        percentage limitation is satisfied at the time of investment or
        contract, a subsequent increase or decrease due to market movements or
        redemptions will not, by itself, result in a violation of that
        limitation.
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>Non-Diversification</b>
        <br />
        <br />
        Each Fund is classified as non-diversified under the 1940 Act. As a
        result, a Fund is not limited by the 1940 Act with respect to the
        percentage of its assets that may be invested in the securities of a
        single issuer. A Fund therefore may invest a larger portion of its
        assets in the securities of a single issuer or a smaller number of
        issuers than a diversified fund, and those issuers may represent a
        greater portion of the Fund's portfolio. This can adversely affect
        performance or subject Shares to greater price volatility than more
        diversified investment companies. In pursuing their objectives, a Fund
        may, subject to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the
        "Code"), hold more than 10% of the outstanding voting securities of an
        issuer.
        <br />
        <br />
        Although each Fund is non-diversified for purposes of the 1940 Act, each
        intends to maintain the diversification required under the Code and
        otherwise operate so as to qualify as a regulated investment company
        ("RIC") for federal income tax purposes, thereby generally avoiding
        fund-level federal income tax on income and gains distributed to
        shareholders. Compliance with the Code's diversification and other
        requirements may limit investment flexibility and could make it less
        likely that a Fund will meet its investment objective. See "Federal
        Income Taxes" in this SAI for further discussion.
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>General Risks</b>
        <br />
        <br />
        The value of a Fund's portfolio securities may fluctuate with changes in
        an issuer's or counterparty's financial condition, with issuer-specific
        or industry-specific developments, and with broader economic or
        political conditions. An investor in a Fund could lose money over short
        or long periods.
        <br />
        <br />
        There is no assurance that a liquid market will exist for all securities
        held by a Fund. Market liquidity may depend on whether dealers are
        willing to make markets in particular securities. There can be no
        assurance that a market will be made or maintained, or that any such
        market will remain liquid. The price at which securities may be sold,
        and the value of Shares, can be adversely affected if trading markets
        for a Fund's portfolio securities are limited or absent, or if bid/ask
        spreads are wide.
        <br />
        <br />
        Financial markets, domestic and foreign, have at times experienced
        unusually high volatility. Continuing events and market turbulence may
        adversely affect Fund performance.
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>Cyber Security Risk.</b> Investment companies and their service
        providers face operational and information-security risks from cyber
        incidents. Cyber events include, among other things, data theft or
        corruption, denial-of-service attacks, unauthorized release of
        confidential information, and other breaches. Cyber incidents affecting
        a Fund or the Adviser, custodian, transfer agent, intermediaries, or
        other third-party service providers may, among other effects, disrupt
        the processing of shareholder transactions, impair a Fund's ability to
        calculate its NAV, cause the release of private shareholder or issuer
        information, impede trading, result in regulatory fines or financial
        losses, and damage reputation. A Fund may also incur additional costs
        for cybersecurity risk management. Similar risks affect issuers in which
        a Fund invests and could have material adverse consequences for such
        issuers, potentially reducing the value of the Fund's investments.
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>Index Tracking Risks.</b> A Fund's return may not match the return of
        the Index for many reasons. For example, a Fund bears operating expenses
        (including taxes) not applicable to the Index and incurs costs
        associated with buying and selling securities, particularly when
        rebalancing its holdings to reflect changes to the Index, or when
        raising cash to meet redemptions or deploying cash from inflows.
        Transaction costs, including brokerage, can reduce a Fund's NAV.
        <br />
        <br />
        Market disruptions or regulatory restrictions may impair a Fund's
        ability to adjust exposures to the levels required to track the Index.
        Unusual market conditions may cause the Index Calculator to postpone a
        scheduled rebalance, which can cause the Index to deviate from its
        typical composition. There is no assurance that the Index Calculator or
        any of its agents will compile or calculate the Index accurately. Errors
        in the quality, accuracy, or completeness of data used to compile the
        Index may occur and may not be identified and corrected promptly,
        particularly for less widely used benchmarks. Gains, losses, or costs
        associated with Index or data errors are generally borne by a Fund and
        its shareholders. For example, during any period when the Index contains
        an incorrect constituent, the Fund would have exposure to that
        constituent and be underexposed to other Index constituents. Such errors
        may positively or negatively affect a Fund and its shareholders.
        <br />
        <br />
        When the Index is rebalanced and a Fund rebalances its portfolio to
        increase correlation with the Index, the resulting transaction costs and
        market exposure are borne directly by the Fund and its shareholders. A
        Fund may not be fully invested at times due to cash flows, or because it
        maintains cash reserves to meet expenses or redemptions. In addition, a
        Fund may not invest in certain securities or other assets included in
        the Index, or may hold them in different proportions than in the Index.
        A Fund's performance may also deviate from the Index due to exchange
        listing standards, a lack of liquidity in markets where Index securities
        trade, tax considerations or other regulatory reasons (such as
        diversification requirements). Liquidity shortfalls may arise from
        market events, economic conditions, or investor sentiment. Illiquid
        securities may be difficult to value and may be valued below comparable
        liquid securities, which can negatively affect performance. A Fund may
        also be delayed in purchasing or selling Index constituents. In volatile
        markets, the ability to sell securities at prices reflecting fair value
        may be impaired, potentially increasing trading costs and index tracking
        risk. A Fund may need to borrow to meet redemptions, which could
        increase expenses. For tax-efficiency, a Fund may sell certain
        securities in ways that realize losses, which can cause performance to
        deviate from the Index. Performance may also deviate due to the impact
        of withholding taxes, late announcements of Index changes, and high
        Index turnover.
        <br />
        <br />
        A Fund may fair value certain investments. To the extent a Fund
        calculates NAV based on fair-valued prices that differ from prices used
        in Index calculations, the Fund's ability to track the Index may be
        adversely affected. The need to comply with the Code's diversification
        and other requirements may also affect tracking. Actions taken in
        response to proposed corporate actions can increase tracking error. In
        light of the foregoing, a Fund's return may deviate significantly from
        the Index's return.
        <br />
        <br />
        Apart from scheduled rebalances, the Index Owner and Index Calculator or
        its agents may implement additional, ad hoc rebalances (for example, to
        correct an error in constituent selection). When the Index is rebalanced
        and a Fund rebalances to increase correlation, any resulting transaction
        costs and interim market exposures are borne by the Fund and its
        shareholders. Errors and ad hoc rebalances may therefore increase costs
        and tracking error risk.
        <br />
        <br />
        Index tracking risk may be heightened during periods of increased market
        volatility or other unusual market conditions. Changes to the Index's
        composition in connection with a rebalance or reconstitution may cause a
        Fund to experience increased volatility, during which time the Fund's
        index tracking risk may be elevated.

        <h3>DESCRIPTION OF PERMITTED INVESTMENTS</h3>
        <br />
        The following describes the investments and techniques the Fund may use,
        and the related risks. The Fund will employ any investment or practice
        below only if it is consistent with the Fund's investment objective and
        permitted by the Fund's stated policies. Some items discussed in this
        SAI are not principal strategies, as disclosed in the Prospectus; while
        the Fund is permitted to use them, it is not required to do so.
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>Borrowing</b>
        <br />
        <br />
        Although the Fund does not expect to borrow, it may do so to the extent
        allowed by the 1940 Act. Under the 1940 Act, the Fund may borrow up to
        one-third (1/3) of its total assets. Any borrowing would be for
        short-term or emergency purposes, not for investment, and would be
        repaid promptly. Borrowing magnifies the effect on NAV of changes in the
        market value of the Fund's holdings. Amounts borrowed bear interest
        (which may or may not be offset by earnings on purchased securities),
        and maintaining a credit facility may involve minimum balances,
        commitment fees, or other costs that increase the effective cost of
        borrowing.
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>Equity Securities</b>
        <br />
        <br />
        Equity securities (for example, common stock) are subject to
        stock-market risk and may fluctuate significantly as market conditions,
        investor sentiment, or an issuer's financial position change. Declines
        in the value of equity holdings may cause the Fund's Shares to fall in
        value.
        <br />
        <br />
        An investment in the Fund entails the risks inherent in equity
        ownership, including the risk that issuer fundamentals deteriorate or
        that broad market conditions weaken, either of which can reduce the
        value of portfolio securities and, in turn, the value of Shares. Equity
        prices can be volatile as investor expectations shift with respect to
        government, economic, monetary, and fiscal policies; inflation and
        interest rates; business cycles; and global or regional political,
        economic, or banking stresses.
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>Types of Equity Securities:</b>
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>Common Stocks -</b> Common stock represents an ownership interest in
        an issuer, typically with voting rights and the potential to receive
        dividends. Unlike preferred stock, dividends on common stock are not
        fixed and are declared at the discretion of the issuer's board of
        directors.
        <br />
        <br />
        Holders of common stock generally take on more risk than holders of
        preferred stock or debt because common shareholders stand behind
        creditors and preferred shareholders in the issuer's capital structure.
        Common stock has neither a stated principal amount nor a maturity date
        and remains subject to market fluctuations as long as it is outstanding.
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>Preferred Stocks -</b> Preferred stock represents an ownership
        interest that typically has priority over common stock for dividends and
        liquidation proceeds, but is junior to the issuer's liabilities.
        Preferred stock generally has no voting rights. Varieties include
        adjustable-rate, fixed-dividend, perpetual, and sinking-fund preferred
        stock.
        <br />
        <br />
        In general, market values of fixed-rate, non-convertible preferred stock
        move inversely with interest rates and with changes in perceived credit
        quality.
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>Rights and Warrants -</b> Rights give existing shareholders the
        privilege to subscribe to a new issue of common stock, usually for a
        short period (often two to four weeks) at a discount to the public
        offering price; rights are typically transferable. Warrants are
        long-dated options, often issued with debt or preferred stock, that
        allow the holder to purchase common shares at a specified price;
        warrants are usually transferable and may trade on exchanges.
        <br />
        <br />
        Rights and warrants may involve greater risk than direct investment in
        the underlying securities. They typically do not convey voting rights,
        dividends, or ownership in the issuer's assets; their values may not
        track the underlying securities; and they can expire worthless if not
        exercised by their expiration dates. Using rights or warrants can
        increase potential gains and losses compared to investing the same
        amount directly in the underlying stock.
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>When-Issued Securities -</b> A when-issued security has defined terms
        and an active market but has not yet been issued. In such transactions
        the Fund relies on the counterparty to deliver. If delivery does not
        occur, the Fund may miss an opportunity to acquire the security at an
        attractive price or yield.
        <br />
        <br />
        Purchasing when-issued securities exposes the Fund to ownership-like
        risks prior to settlement, including price and yield changes. By
        settlement, the market value may be higher or lower than the agreed
        purchase price, and prevailing yields may differ from those available
        when the trade was executed. Because payment is deferred until delivery,
        these risks are in addition to the risks of the Fund's other
        investments.
        <br />
        <br />
        SEC Rule 18f-4 under the 1940 Act (the "Derivatives Rule") permits
        investments on a when-issued, forward-settling, or non-standard
        settlement basis notwithstanding Section 18's senior-security
        restrictions, provided the Fund intends to physically settle and
        settlement will occur within 35 days of the trade date (the
        "Delayed-Settlement Securities" provision). Transactions that do not
        meet that provision are treated as derivatives under Rule 18f-4.
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>Illiquid Investments and Restricted Securities</b>
        <br />
        <br />
        Under Rule 22e-4, the Fund may not acquire any illiquid investment if,
        immediately after purchase, more than 15% of its net assets would be
        invested in illiquid investments that are assets. An "illiquid
        investment" is one the Fund reasonably expects it cannot sell or dispose
        of, under current market conditions, within seven calendar days without
        materially affecting the investment's market value. The Fund maintains a
        liquidity risk management program and procedures to identify illiquid
        investments pursuant to Rule 22e-4. The 15% limit is observed on an
        ongoing basis.
        <br />
        <br />
        The Fund may purchase restricted securities that may be resold to
        institutional investors and that, under the Fund's liquidity program,
        may be determined not to be illiquid. Many such securities trade in the
        institutional market under Rule 144A of the Securities Act and are
        referred to as Rule 144A securities.
        <br />
        <br />
        Illiquid investments generally involve more risk than comparable,
        readily marketable securities. They may trade at a discount, may be
        harder to sell at a fair price or in a timely manner, and may prevent
        the Fund from taking advantage of market opportunities. Risks are most
        acute when the Fund needs cash (for example, during periods of net
        redemptions), potentially necessitating borrowing or sales at
        unfavorable prices.
        <br />
        <br />
        Illiquid investments are often privately placed and may not be listed or
        traded on established markets. They may not be freely transferable under
        applicable law or due to contractual resale restrictions. If privately
        placed securities can only be sold through private negotiations, the
        realized price may be below the Fund's purchase price or below fair
        value. Issuers that are not public may be subject to less stringent
        disclosure and investor-protection requirements. If registration is
        required before resale, the Fund may bear those costs. Private
        placements may involve smaller, less seasoned issuers with limited
        product lines, markets, financial resources, or management depth, and
        the Fund may receive material non-public information that can restrict
        trading.
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>Investment Company Securities</b>
        <br />
        <br />
        The Fund may invest in other investment companies, including money
        market funds and ETFs, subject to Section 12(d)(1) of the 1940 Act and
        related rules. Investing through another pooled vehicle exposes the Fund
        to that vehicle's risks. Fund shareholders will indirectly bear their
        proportionate share of the acquired fund's fees and expenses (including
        advisory fees), in addition to fees and expenses the Fund bears
        directly.
        <br />
        <br />
        Under Section 12(d)(1), immediately after purchase the Fund may not: (1)
        own more than 3% of the acquired company's outstanding voting stock; (2)
        invest in the acquired company's securities with an aggregate value
        exceeding 5% of the Fund's total assets; or (3) invest in the securities
        of the acquired company and all other investment companies in excess of
        10% of the Fund's total assets. To the extent permitted by law or
        regulation, the Fund may invest in money market funds beyond these
        limits.
        <br />
        <br />
        Registered funds may invest in other investment companies beyond Section
        12(d)(1) limits if certain conditions are met. The Fund may rely on Rule
        12d1-4, which provides an exemption allowing investments in other
        registered funds, including ETFs, subject to conditions (for example,
        the Fund and its advisory group may not control, individually or in the
        aggregate, an acquired fund, generally meaning ownership of no more than
        25% of the voting securities of a registered open-end fund).
        <br />
        <br />
        The Fund may also rely on Section 12(d)(1)(F) and Rule 12d1-3, which
        provide an exemption permitting investment in other registered funds
        (including ETFs) if, among other conditions: (1) the Fund, together with
        its affiliates, acquires no more than 3% of the outstanding voting stock
        of any acquired fund; and (2) sales loads on Shares do not exceed FINRA
        Rule 2830 limits.
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>Money Market Funds</b>
        <br />
        <br />
        The Fund may invest in underlying money market funds that seek to
        maintain a stable $1 NAV ("stable NAV" funds) or whose share prices
        fluctuate ("variable NAV" funds). Investments in stable NAV funds can
        still lose value. Variable NAV funds can be worth more or less than the
        Fund paid when sold. Neither type is designed to provide capital
        appreciation. Certain money market funds may impose liquidity fees or
        temporarily suspend redemptions if liquidity falls below required
        thresholds.
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>Other Short-Term Instruments</b>
        <br />
        <br />
        For liquidity or other purposes, the Fund may hold short-term
        instruments on an ongoing basis, including but not limited to: (1)
        shares of money market funds; (2) obligations of the U.S. government,
        its agencies, or instrumentalities (including government-sponsored
        enterprises); (3) negotiable certificates of deposit ("CDs"), bankers'
        acceptances, fixed time deposits, and other obligations of U.S. and
        non-U.S. banks (including foreign branches) and any similar
        institutions; (4) commercial paper rated Prime-1 by Moody's Investors
        Service or A-1 by S&P Global Ratings, or of comparable quality if
        unrated as determined by the Adviser; (5) non-convertible corporate debt
        with remaining maturities of 397 days or less that meets Rule 2a-7
        rating criteria; and (6) short-term, U.S. dollar-denominated obligations
        of non-U.S. banks (including their U.S. branches) that, in the Adviser's
        opinion, are of comparable quality to eligible U.S. bank obligations.
        Such instruments may be purchased on a current or forward-settled basis.
        Time deposits are non-negotiable bank deposits for a stated period and
        rate. Bankers' acceptances are time drafts drawn on banks, typically in
        international trade.
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>Securities Lending</b>
        <br />
        <br />
        If approved by the Board, the Fund may lend portfolio securities to
        qualified borrowers. Borrowers must provide collateral at least equal to
        the current value of the loaned securities and maintain such collateral
        while the loan is outstanding. The Fund may recall a securities loan at
        any time and recall the securities. The Fund will receive the value of
        any interest or cash/non-cash distributions on loaned securities;
        substitute payments in lieu of dividends generally do not qualify as
        qualified dividend income.
        <br />
        <br />
        For cash-collateralized loans, the borrower typically receives a fee
        based on the cash collateral; the Fund seeks to earn more on reinvested
        cash collateral than it pays to the borrower. For non-cash collateral,
        the borrower pays the Fund a fee based on the value of securities on
        loan. Cash collateral may be reinvested in short-term instruments,
        either directly or through joint accounts or money market funds, which
        may be managed by the Adviser.
        <br />
        <br />
        The Fund may share a portion of lending income with borrowers as
        described above and with one or more lending agents approved by the
        Board. Lending agents administer the program under Board-approved
        guidelines, including delivering and recalling securities, obtaining and
        maintaining collateral, monitoring collateral and loan values daily,
        requesting collateral adjustments, and providing recordkeeping and
        accounting.
        <br />
        <br />
        Securities lending involves risks, including operational risk
        (settlement or accounting issues), "gap" risk (a mismatch between
        returns on collateral reinvestment and fees owed to the borrower), and
        credit, legal, counterparty, and market risks. If a borrower fails to
        return securities, the Fund could incur a loss if collateral liquidation
        proceeds do not at least equal the value of the loaned securities plus
        costs to purchase replacements.
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>Tax Risks</b>
        <br />
        <br />
        You should consider the tax treatment of an investment in Shares. The
        tax information in the Prospectus and this SAI is general in nature.
        Consult your tax adviser about the federal, state, local, and non-U.S.
        tax consequences of investing in Shares.
        <br />
        <br />
        Unless Shares are held through a tax-deferred or other tax-advantaged
        account (such as an individual retirement account), you should consider
        potential tax consequences when the Fund makes distributions or when you
        sell Shares.
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>Temporary Defensive Strategies</b>
        <br />
        <br />
        Under normal market conditions, the Fund seeks to remain fully invested
        in accordance with its principal strategies. In adverse market,
        economic, political, or other conditions, the Fund may, for temporary
        defensive purposes, invest up to 100% of its assets in cash or cash
        equivalents, such as U.S. government obligations, investment-grade debt,
        and other money market instruments. Taking a defensive position may
        prevent the Fund from achieving its investment objective.

        <h3>INVESTMENT RESTRICTIONS</h3>
        <br />
        The Trust has adopted the following investment restrictions as
        fundamental policies with respect to the Fund. These restrictions cannot
        be changed for the Fund without the approval of the holders of a
        majority of the Fund's outstanding voting securities. For purposes of
        the 1940 Act, a "majority of the outstanding voting securities" means
        the lesser of: (1) 67% or more of the voting securities present (if
        holders of more than 50% of the outstanding voting securities are
        present or represented by proxy); or (2) more than 50% of the
        outstanding voting securities of the Fund.
        <br />
        <br />
        Except with the approval of a majority of the outstanding voting
        securities, the Fund may not:
        <br />
        <br />
        <ul>
          <li>
            1. Borrow money or issue senior securities, as that term is defined
            in the 1940 Act, except to the extent permitted by the 1940 Act.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            2. Make loans, except to the extent permitted under the 1940 Act.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            3. Purchase or sell real estate, except when obtained through
            ownership of securities or other instruments and only to the extent
            allowed by the 1940 Act. This does not prevent the Fund from
            investing in securities or other instruments backed by real estate,
            real estate investment trusts ("REITs"), or securities of companies
            engaged in the real estate business.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            4. Purchase or sell commodities, except when exposure arises
            incidentally through other instruments and only as permitted by the
            1940 Act. This does not prevent the Fund from purchasing or selling
            options and futures contracts or from investing in securities or
            other instruments backed by physical commodities.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            5. Underwrite securities issued by other persons, except to the
            extent permitted under the 1940 Act.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            6. Concentrate its investments (that is, invest more than 25% of
            total assets) in any one industry or group of related industries,
            except that the Fund will mirror the Index's level of industry
            concentration. For this test, U.S. government securities (and
            agencies/instrumentalities), repurchase agreements backed by U.S.
            government securities, investment companies, and municipal
            securities are not treated as belonging to any industry.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        In determining compliance with its concentration policy, the Fund will
        "look through" to the holdings of any investment company that discloses
        its portfolio daily. If an acquired fund does not publish holdings daily
        but states that it concentrates, or otherwise discloses concentration in
        a particular industry or group of industries, the Fund will treat it as
        concentrated accordingly. Additionally, in determining compliance with
        the fundamental investment concentration policy, the Fund will look
        through to the ultimate user or use of proceeds of private-activity
        municipal bonds to assign their industry.
        <br />
        <br />
        If a percentage limitation is satisfied at the time of investment or
        contract, a subsequent increase or decrease resulting from any change in
        value or in total or net assets will not, by itself, result in a
        violation of such restriction, except that the percentage limits on
        borrowing and on illiquid investments are monitored on a continuous
        basis.

        <h3>EXCHANGE LISTING AND TRADING</h3>
        <br />
        Shares are listed for trading and trade throughout the day on the
        Exchange.
        <br />
        <br />
        There can be no assurance that the Fund will continue to meet the
        Exchange's requirements necessary to maintain the listing of Shares. The
        Exchange may, but is not required to, remove Shares of the Fund from
        listing under any of the following circumstances: (1) the Exchange
        becomes aware that the Fund is no longer eligible to operate in reliance
        on Rule 6c-11 under the 1940 Act; (2) the Fund no longer complies with
        the Exchange's requirements for Shares; or (3) such other event or
        condition exists that, in the opinion of the Exchange, makes continued
        listing imprudent. The Exchange will also delist the Shares upon the
        Fund's termination of the Fund.
        <br />
        <br />
        The Trust reserves the right to adjust the price levels of Shares in the
        future to help maintain convenient trading ranges for investors. Any
        such changes would be implemented via stock splits or reverse stock
        splits.

        <h3>MANAGEMENT OF THE TRUST</h3>
        <br />
        <b>Board Responsibilities.</b> The Board oversees the management and
        operations of the Trust. As with other mutual funds and ETFs, the
        day-to-day management and operations of the Trust are carried out by
        service providers to the Trust, including the Adviser, the Distributor,
        the Administrator, any Sub-Administrator, the Custodian, and the
        Transfer Agent, each of which is discussed elsewhere in this SAI. The
        Board has appointed certain senior personnel of the Administrator as
        officers of the Trust, with responsibility to monitor the Trust's
        operations and report to the Board. In carrying out its oversight, the
        Board receives regular reports from these officers and from the Trust's
        service providers. For example, the Treasurer reports on financial
        reporting matters and the President reports on operational matters. In
        addition, the Adviser provides regular reports regarding the investment
        strategy and performance of the Fund. The Board has appointed a Chief
        Compliance Officer who administers the Trust's compliance program and
        reports regularly to the Board on compliance matters. These reports are
        provided as part of formal Board meetings, typically held quarterly and
        often in person, during which the Board reviews recent operations.
        Between formal meetings, members of the Board may also meet with
        management in less formal settings to discuss Trust matters. The role of
        the Board, and of each Trustee, is one of oversight rather than
        day-to-day management; this oversight role does not make the Board a
        guarantor of the Trust's investments, operations, or activities.
        <br />
        <br />
        As part of its oversight function, the Board receives and reviews a
        variety of different risk management reports and discusses risk matters
        with appropriate management and other personnel. Because risk management
        encompasses many elements (for example, investment risk, issuer and
        counterparty risk, compliance risk, operational and business continuity
        risks), oversight of different categories of risk is handled in
        different ways. The Board meets regularly with the Chief Compliance
        Officer to discuss compliance and operational risks, and the Audit
        Committee meets with the Trust's independent registered public
        accounting firm regarding, among other things, the internal control
        structure of the Trust's financial reporting function.
        <br />
        <br />
        The full Board also receives reports from the Adviser regarding the
        Fund's investment risks. From time to time, the Board receives
        additional reports from the Administrator and the Adviser regarding
        enterprise risk management.
        <br />
        <br />
        The Board recognizes that not all risks that may affect the Fund can be
        identified or quantified; that it may not be practical or cost-effective
        to eliminate or mitigate certain risks; that certain risks (such as
        investment risk) may be necessary to achieve the Fund's goals; and that
        the processes and controls used to address risks have inherent
        limitations. Moreover, the risk reports provided to the Board are
        typically summaries. Most of the Fund's investment management and
        business affairs are carried out by or through the Adviser and other
        service providers, each of which has its own risk management policies
        and practices that may differ from the Trust's or from one another in
        priorities, resources, and control effectiveness. For these and other
        reasons, the Board's ability to monitor and manage risk, as a practical
        matter, has limitations.

        "Independent Trustees"). Mr. Nicolas S. Laqua serves as Chairman of the

        liaison between the Independent Trustees and management. [ ] currently

        <h3>Individual Trustee Qualifications.</h3>
        <br />
        The Board believes that each of the Trustees has the qualifications,
        experience, attributes and skills (�Trustee Attributes�) appropriate to
        their service as Trustees of the Trust in light of the Trust�s business
        and structure. Each of the Trustees has substantial business and
        professional backgrounds that indicate they have the ability to
        critically review, evaluate and access information provided to them.
        Certain of these business and professional experiences are set forth in
        detail in the table above. The Board annually conducts a
        �self-assessment� wherein the effectiveness of the Board and individual
        Trustees is reviewed.
        <br />
        <br />
        In addition to the information provided in the table above, below is
        certain additional information concerning each particular Trustee and
        certain of their Trustee Attributes. The information provided below, and
        in the table above, is not all-inclusive. Many Trustee Attributes
        involve intangible elements, such as intelligence, integrity, work
        ethic, the ability to work together, the ability to communicate
        effectively, the ability to exercise judgment, the ability to ask
        incisive questions, and commitment to shareholder interests. In
        conducting its annual self-assessment, the Board has determined that the
        Trustees have the appropriate attributes and experience to serve
        effectively as Trustees of the Trust.
        <br />
        <br />
        The Board has concluded that Mr. Marquina should serve as a Trustee
        because of his substantial business experience related to commercial
        real estate investment and business development through his current
        position as CEO and Founder at ARQ Consultants Inc., as well as through
        former positions. The Board believes Mr. Marquina�s experience,
        qualifications, attributes, or skills, on an individual basis and in
        combination with those of the other Trustees, led to the conclusion that
        he possesses the requisite skills and attributes as a Trustee to carry
        out oversight responsibilities with respect to the Trust.
        <br />
        <br />
        The Board has concluded that Ms. McDonough should serve as a Trustee
        because of her substantial financial services experience, including
        experience with operations, compliance, IT, service provider oversight
        and management. For over a decade, Ms. McDonough has served as COO of
        Trillium Asset Management and in that capacity oversees all
        non-investment functions for the firm. The Board believes Ms. McDonough
        experience, qualifications, attributes, or skills, on an individual
        basis and in combination with those of the other Trustees, led to the
        conclusion that he possesses the requisite skills and attributes as a
        Trustee to carry out oversight responsibilities with respect to the
        Trust.
        <br />
        <br />
        The Board has concluded that Mr. Norris should serve as a Trustee
        because of his substantial experience across multitude of industries and
        operated businesses. Mr. Norris� business operation experience consists
        of capital raising, business development, investor relations, strategic
        planning, treasury management, deal execution, restructuring oversight
        of back-office functions. Mr. Norris serves as the Trust�s Audit
        Committee Financial Expert. The Board believes Mr. Norris� experience,
        qualifications, attributes, or skills, on an individual basis and in
        combination with those of the other Trustees, led to the conclusion that
        he possesses the requisite skills and attributes as a Trustee to carry
        out oversight responsibilities with respect to the Trust.
        <br />
        <br />
        The Board has concluded that Mr. Falkeis should serve as a Trustee
        because of his substantial investment company experience and his
        experience with financial, accounting, investment, and regulatory
        matters through his former position as Senior Vice President and Chief
        Financial Officer (and other positions) of U.S. Bancorp Fund Services,
        LLC, doing business as U.S. Bank Global Fund Services (�Global Fund
        Services� or the �Transfer Agent�), a full service provider to ETFs,
        mutual funds, and alternative investment products, from 1997 to 2013, as
        well as a Trustee and Chairman of the Tidal ETF Trust, from 2018 to
        present. In addition, he has experience consulting with investment
        advisors regarding the legal structure of mutual funds, distribution
        channel analysis, and actual distribution of those funds. Mr. Falkeis
        also has substantial managerial, operational, technological, and risk
        oversight related experience through his former position as Chief
        Operating Officer of the advisers to the Direxion mutual fund and ETF
        complex. The Board believes Mr. Falkeis� experience, qualifications,
        attributes, or skills on an individual basis and in combination with
        those of the other Trustees led to the conclusion that he possesses the
        requisite skills and attributes as a Trustee to carry out oversight
        responsibilities with respect to the Trust.

        <h3>Board Committees.</h3>
        The Board has established the following standing committees of the
        Board:
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>Audit Committee.</b> The Board has a standing Audit Committee that is
        composed of each of the Independent Trustees of the Trust and is chaired
        by an Independent Trustee. Mr. Norris is chair of the Audit Committee
        and he presides at the Audit Committee meetings, participates in
        formulating agendas for Audit Committee meetings, and coordinates with
        management to serve as a liaison between the Independent Trustees and
        management on matters within the scope of responsibilities of the Audit
        Committee as set forth in its Board-approved written charter. The
        principal responsibilities of the Audit Committee include overseeing the
        Trust�s accounting and financial reporting policies and practices and
        its internal controls; overseeing the quality, objectivity and integrity
        of the Trust�s financial statements and the independent audits thereof;
        monitoring the independent auditor�s qualifications, independence, and
        performance; acting as a liaison between the Trust�s independent
        auditors and the full Board; pre-approving all auditing services to be
        performed for the Trust; reviewing the compensation and overseeing the
        work of the independent auditor (including resolution of disagreements
        between management and the independent auditor regarding financial
        reporting) for the purpose of preparing or issuing an audit report or
        related work; pre-approving all permitted non-audit services (including
        the fees and terms thereof) to be performed for the Trust; pre-approving
        all permitted non-audit services to be performed for any investment
        adviser or sub-adviser to the Trust by any of the Trust�s independent
        auditors if the engagement relates directly to the operations and
        financial reporting of the Trust; meeting with the Trust�s independent
        auditors as necessary to (1) review the arrangement for and scope of the
        annual audits and any special audits, (2) discuss any matters of concern
        relating to the Fund�s financial statements, (3) consider the
        independent auditors� comments with respect to the Trust�s financial
        policies, procedures and internal accounting controls and Trust
        management�s responses thereto, and (4) review the form of opinion the
        independent auditors propose to render to the Board and the Fund�s
        shareholders; discussing with management and the independent auditor
        significant financial reporting issues and judgments made in connection
        with the preparation of the Fund�s financial statements; and reviewing
        and discussing reports from the independent auditors on (1) all critical
        accounting policies and practices to be used, (2) all alternative
        treatments within generally accepted accounting principles for policies
        and practices related to material items that have been discussed with
        management, (3) other material written communications between the
        independent auditor and management, including any management letter,
        schedule of unadjusted differences, or management representation letter,
        and (4) all non-audit services provided to any entity in the Trust that
        were not pre-approved by the Committee; and reviewing disclosures made
        to the Committee by the Trust�s principal executive officer and
        principal accounting officer during their certification process for the
        Fund�s Form N-CSR. As of the date of this SAI, the Audit Committee met
        [one] time with respect to the Fund.
        <br />
        <br />
        The Audit Committee also serves as the Qualified Legal Compliance
        Committee (�QLCC�) for the Trust for the purpose of compliance with
        Rules 205.2(k) and 205.3(c) of the Code of Federal Regulations,
        regarding alternative reporting procedures for attorneys retained or
        employed by an issuer who appear and practice before the SEC on behalf
        of the issuer (the �issuer attorneys�). An issuer attorney who becomes
        aware of evidence of a material violation by the Trust, or by any
        officer, director, employee, or agent of the Trust, may report evidence
        of such material violation to the QLCC as an alternative to the
        reporting requirements of Rule 205.3(b) (which requires reporting to the
        chief legal officer and potentially escalating further to other
        entities). As of the date of this SAI, the QLCC has not met with respect
        to the Trust.
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>Nominating and Governance Committee.</b> The Board has a standing
        Nominating and Governance Committee that is composed of each of the
        Independent Trustees of the Trust. The Nominating and Governance
        Committee operates under a written charter approved by the Board. The
        Nominating and Governance Committee is responsible for seeking and
        reviewing candidates for consideration as nominees for Trustees as is
        considered necessary from time to time and meets only as necessary. The
        Nominating and Governance Committee generally will not consider nominees
        recommended by shareholders. The Nominating and Governance Committee is
        also responsible for, among other things, reviewing and making
        recommendations regarding Independent Trustee compensation and the
        Trustees� annual �self-assessment.� Ms. McDonough is the chair of the
        Nominating and Governance Committee. The Nominating Committee meets
        periodically, as necessary, but at least annually. Because the Fund has
        not yet commenced operations, the Nominating and Governance Committee
        has not yet met or taken any action with respect to the Fund as of the
        date of the SAI.

        <h3>Board Compensation.</h3>
        The Independent Trustees will each receive a quarterly retainer of
        $25,000 plus $5,000 for each meeting attended. The Independent Trustees
        also receive reimbursement for travel and other out-of-pocket expenses
        incurred in connection with serving as a Trustee. In addition, the Lead
        Independent Trustee receives an annual retainer of $35,000 and the Audit
        Committee Chair receives an annual retainer of $30,000. The Trust has no
        pension or retirement plan.

        The following table shows the compensation estimated to be earned by
        each Trustee for the Fund�s current fiscal year ending [ ], 2025.
        Independent Trustee fees are an obligation of the Trust and are paid by

          PRINCIPAL SHAREHOLDERS, CONTROL PERSONS AND MANAGEMENT OWNERSHIP
        </h3>
        <br />
        A principal shareholder is any person who owns of record or beneficially
        5% or more of the outstanding Shares. A control person is a shareholder
        that owns beneficially or through controlled companies more than 25% of
        the voting securities of a company or acknowledges the existence of
        control. Shareholders owning voting securities in excess of 25% may

        <h3>CODES OF ETHICS</h3>
        <br />
        The Trust and the Adviser have each adopted codes of ethics pursuant to
        Rule 17j-1 of the 1940 Act. These codes of ethics are designed to
        prevent affiliated persons of the Trust and the Adviser from engaging in
        deceptive, manipulative, or fraudulent activities in connection with
        securities held or to be acquired by the Fund (which may also be held by
        persons subject to the codes of ethics). Each code of ethics permits
        personnel subject to that code of ethics to invest in securities for
        their personal investment accounts, subject to certain limitations,
        including limitations related to securities that may be purchased or
        held by the Fund. The Distributor (as defined below) relies on the
        principal underwriters exception under Rule 17j-1(c)(3), specifically
        where the Distributor is not affiliated with the Trust or the Adviser,
        and no officer, director, or general partner of the Distributor serves
        as an officer, director, or general partner of the Trust or the Adviser.
        <br />
        <br />
        There can be no assurance that the codes of ethics will be effective in
        preventing such activities. Each code of ethics may be found at the
        SEC�s website at http://www.sec.gov.

        <h3>PROXY VOTING POLICIES</h3>
        <br />
        The Board has delegated proxy voting responsibilities to the Adviser,
        subject to the Board�s oversight. In delegating proxy responsibilities,
        the Board has directed that proxies be voted consistent with the Fund�s
        and its shareholders� best interests and in compliance with all
        applicable proxy voting rules and regulations. The Adviser has adopted
        proxy voting policies and guidelines for this purpose (�Proxy Voting
        Policies�), which have been adopted by the Trust as the policies and
        procedures that will be used when voting proxies on behalf of the Fund.
        <br />
        <br />
        In the absence of a conflict of interest, the Adviser will generally
        vote �for� routine proposals, such as the election of directors,
        approval of auditors, and amendments or revisions to corporate documents
        to eliminate outdated or unnecessary provisions. Unusual or disputed
        proposals will be reviewed and voted on a case-by-case basis. The Proxy
        Voting Policies address, among other things, material conflicts of
        interest that may arise between the interests of the Fund and the
        interests of the Adviser. The Proxy Voting Policies will ensure that all
        issues brought to shareholders are analyzed in light of the Adviser�s
        fiduciary responsibilities.
        <br />
        <br />
        The Trust�s Chief Compliance Officer is responsible for monitoring the
        effectiveness of the Proxy Voting Policies.
        <br />
        <br />
        When available, information on how the Fund voted proxies relating to
        portfolio securities during the most recent 12-month period ended June
        30 will be available <sup>(1)</sup> without charge, upon request, by

        <h3>INVESTMENT ADVISER</h3>
        <br />
        Tidal Investments LLC, a Tidal Financial Group company, located at 234
        West Florida Street, Suite 203, Milwaukee, Wisconsin 53204, serves as
        investment adviser to the Fund and has overall responsibility for the
        general management and administration of the Fund.
        <br />
        <br />
        Pursuant to the Investment Advisory Agreement (the �Advisory
        Agreement�), the Adviser provides investment advice to the Fund and
        oversees the day-to-day operations of the Fund subject to the direction
        and oversight of the Board. The Adviser is responsible for the
        day-to-day management of the Fund�s portfolio, including determining the
        securities purchased and sold by the Fund and trading portfolio
        securities on behalf of the Fund. Under the Advisory Agreement, the
        Adviser is also responsible for arranging transfer agency, custody, fund
        administration and accounting, and other related services necessary for
        the Fund to operate. The Adviser administers the Fund�s business
        affairs, provides office facilities and equipment and certain clerical,
        bookkeeping, and administrative services. Under the Advisory Agreement,
        in exchange for a single unitary management fee from the Fund, the
        Adviser has agreed to pay all expenses incurred by the Fund except for
        the Excluded Expenses, as defined in the Prospectus. For services
        provided to the Fund, the Fund pays the Adviser a unitary management fee
        at an annual rate of [ ]%, which is calculated daily and paid monthly,
        based on the Fund�s average daily net assets.
        <br />
        <br />
        The Advisory Agreement with respect to the Fund will continue in force
        for an initial period of two years. Thereafter, the Advisory Agreement
        will be renewable from year to year with respect to the Fund, so long as
        its continuance is approved at least annually <sup>(1)</sup> by the
        vote, cast in person (or in another manner permitted by the 1940 Act or
        pursuant to exemptive relief therefrom) at a meeting called for that
        purpose, of a majority of those Trustees who are not �interested
        persons� of the Adviser or the Trust; and <sup>(2)</sup> by the majority
        vote of either the full Board or the vote of a majority of the
        outstanding Shares. The Advisory Agreement automatically terminates on
        assignment and is terminable on a 60-day written notice either by the
        Trust or the Adviser.
        <br />
        <br />
        The Adviser shall not be liable to the Trust or any shareholder for
        anything done or omitted by it, except acts or omissions involving
        willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence or reckless disregard
        of the duties imposed upon it by its agreement with the Trust or for any
        losses that may be sustained in the purchase, holding, or sale of any
        security.

        Shares as of the end of the most recently completed fiscal year. Dollar
        amount ranges disclosed are established by the SEC. �Beneficial

        <b>Portfolio Manager Compensation.</b> Ms. Duan is compensated by the
        Adviser with a base salary and discretionary bonus based on the
        financial performance and profitability of the Adviser and not based on
        the performance of the Fund. Ms. Duan is an equity owner of the Adviser,
        and therefore may benefit indirectly from the revenue generated by the

        the Adviser with a base salary and a discretionary bonus based on the
        financial performance and profitability of the Adviser, and not based on
        the performance of the Fund. As of the date of this SAI, he has been
        issued membership units in the Adviser that have not yet vested. Once

        <br />
        <b>Description of Material Conflicts of Interest.</b> The portfolio
        managers� management of �other accounts� may give rise to potential
        conflicts of interest in connection with their management of the Fund�s
        investments, on the one hand, and the investments of the other accounts,
        on the other. The other accounts may have similar investment objectives
        or strategies as the Fund. A potential conflict of interest may arise as
        a result, whereby a portfolio manager could favor one account over
        another. Another potential conflict could include a portfolio manager�s
        knowledge about the size, timing, and possible market impact of Fund
        trades, whereby a portfolio manager could use this information to the
        advantage of other accounts and to the disadvantage of the Fund. For
        instance, the portfolio managers may receive fees from certain accounts
        that are higher than the fees received from the Fund, or receive a
        performance-based fee on certain accounts. In those instances, a
        portfolio manager has an incentive to favor the higher and/or
        performance-based fee accounts over the Fund. To mitigate these
        conflicts, the Adviser has established policies and procedures to ensure
        that the purchase and sale of securities among all accounts the firm
        manages are fairly and equitably allocated.

        <br />
        The Trust and Foreside Fund Services, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of
        Foreside Financial Group (dba ACA Group) (the �Distributor�), are
        parties to a distribution agreement (�Distribution Agreement�), whereby
        the Distributor acts as principal underwriter for the Fund and
        distributes Shares on a best efforts basis. Shares are continuously
        offered for sale by the Distributor only in Creation Units. The
        Distributor will not distribute Shares in amounts less than a Creation
        Unit and does not maintain a secondary market in Shares. The principal
        business address of the Distributor is Three Canal Plaza, Suite 100,
        Portland, ME 04101.
        <br />
        Under the Distribution Agreement, the Distributor, as agent for the
        Trust, will review orders for the purchase and redemption of Creation
        Units, provided that any subscriptions and orders will not be binding on
        the Trust until accepted by the Trust. The Distributor is a
        broker-dealer registered under the 1934 Act and a member of FINRA.
        <br />
        <br />
        The Distributor may also enter into agreements with securities dealers
        (�Soliciting Dealers�) who will solicit purchases of Creation Units of
        Shares. Such Soliciting Dealers may also be Authorized Participants (as
        discussed in �Procedures for Purchase of Creation Units� below) or DTC
        participants (as defined below).
        <br />
        <br />
        The Distribution Agreement will continue for two years from its
        effective date and is renewable annually thereafter. The continuance of
        the Distribution Agreement must be specifically approved at least
        annually
        <sup>(1)</sup> by the vote of the Trustees or by a vote of the
        shareholders of the Fund and <sup>(2)</sup> by the vote of a majority of
        the Independent Trustees who have no direct or indirect financial
        interest in the operations of the Distribution Agreement or any related
        agreement, cast in person (or in another manner permitted by the 1940
        Act or pursuant to exemptive relief therefrom) at a meeting called for
        the purpose of voting on such approval. The Distribution Agreement is
        terminable without penalty by the Trust on 60 days� written notice when
        authorized either by majority vote of its outstanding voting Shares or
        by a vote of a majority of its Board (including a majority of the
        Independent Trustees), or by the Distributor on 60 days� written notice,
        and will automatically terminate in the event of its assignment. The
        Distribution Agreement provides that, in the absence of willful
        misfeasance, bad faith, or gross negligence on the part of the
        Distributor, or reckless disregard by it of its obligations thereunder,
        the Distributor shall not be liable for any action or failure to act in
        accordance with its duties thereunder.
        <br />
        <br />
        The Fund is new and has not incurred any underwriting commissions and
        the Distributor has not retained any amounts as of the date of this SAI.
        <br />
        <br />
        Intermediary Compensation. The Adviser or its affiliates, out of its own
        resources and not out of Fund assets (i.e., without additional cost to
        the Fund or its shareholders), may pay certain broker dealers, banks,
        and other financial intermediaries (�Intermediaries�) for certain
        activities related to the Fund, including participation in activities
        that are designed to make Intermediaries more knowledgeable about
        exchange traded products, including the Fund, or for other activities,
        such as marketing and educational training or support. These
        arrangements are not financed by the Fund and, thus, do not result in
        increased Fund expenses. They are not reflected in the fees and expenses
        listed in the fees and expenses sections of the Fund�s Prospectus and
        they do not change the price paid by investors for the purchase of
        Shares or the amount received by a shareholder as proceeds from the
        redemption of Shares.
        <br />
        <br />
        Such compensation may be paid to Intermediaries that provide services to
        the Fund, including marketing and education support (such as through
        conferences, webinars, and printed communications). The Adviser will
        periodically assess the advisability of continuing to make these
        payments. Payments to an Intermediary may be significant to the
        Intermediary, and amounts that Intermediaries pay to your adviser,
        broker, or other investment professional, if any, may also be
        significant to such adviser, broker, or investment professional. Because
        an Intermediary may make decisions about what investment options it will
        make available or recommend, and what services to provide in connection
        with various products, based on payments it receives or is eligible to
        receive, such payments create conflicts of interest between the
        Intermediary and its clients. For example, these financial incentives
        may cause the Intermediary to recommend the Fund over other investments.
        The same conflict of interest exists with respect to your financial
        adviser, broker, or investment professional if they receive similar
        payments from their Intermediary firm.
        <br />
        <br />
        Intermediary information is current only as of the date of this SAI.
        Please contact your adviser, broker, or other investment professional
        for more information regarding any payments their Intermediary firm may
        receive. Any payments made by the Adviser or its affiliates to an
        Intermediary may create the incentive for an Intermediary to encourage
        customers to buy Shares.
        <br />
        <br />
        If you have any additional questions, please call (833) 333-9383.

        <br />
        Distribution (Rule 12b-1) Plan. The Trust has adopted a Distribution
        (Rule 12b-1) Plan (the �Plan�) in accordance with the provisions of Rule
        12b-1 under the 1940 Act. No payments pursuant to the Plan are expected
        to be made during the twelve (12) month period from the date of this
        SAI. Rule 12b-1 fees to be paid by the Fund under the Plan may only be
        imposed after approval by the Board.
        <br />
        <br />
        Continuance of the Plan must be approved annually by a majority of the
        Trustees of the Trust and by a majority of the Trustees who are not
        interested persons (as defined in the 1940 Act) of the Trust and have no
        direct or indirect financial interest in the Plan or in any agreements
        related to the Plan (�Disinterested Trustees�). None of the Trustees
        have a direct or indirect financial interest in the Plan or in any
        agreements related to the Plan. The Plan may be continued from
        year-to-year only if the Board, including a majority of the
        Disinterested Trustees, concludes at least annually that continuation of
        the Plan is likely to benefit shareholders. The Board has determined
        that the Plan is likely to benefit the Fund by providing an incentive
        for brokers, dealers, and other financial intermediaries to engage in
        sales and marketing efforts on behalf of the Fund and to provide
        enhanced services to shareholders. The Board also determined that the
        Plan may enhance the Fund�s ability to sell shares and access important
        distribution channels.

        <br />

        <br />
        The Plan requires that quarterly written reports of amounts spent under
        the Plan and the purposes of such expenditures be furnished to and
        reviewed by the Trustees. The Plan may not be amended to increase
        materially the amount that may be spent thereunder without approval by a
        majority of the outstanding Shares. All material amendments of the Plan
        will require approval by a majority of the Trustees of the Trust and of
        the Disinterested Trustees.
        <br />
        <br />
        The Plan provides that the Fund pays the Distributor an annual fee of up
        to a maximum of 0.25% of the average daily net assets of the Shares.
        Under the Plan, the Distributor may make payments pursuant to written
        agreements to financial institutions and intermediaries such as banks,
        savings and loan associations, and insurance companies including,
        without limit, investment counselors, broker-dealers, and the
        Distributor�s affiliates and subsidiaries (collectively, �Agents�) as
        compensation for services and reimbursement of expenses incurred in
        connection with distribution assistance. The Plan is characterized as a
        compensation plan since the distribution fee will be paid to the
        Distributor without regard to the distribution expenses incurred by the
        Distributor or the amount of payments made to other financial
        institutions and intermediaries. The Trust intends to operate the Plan
        in accordance with its terms and with FINRA rules concerning sales
        charges.
        <br />
        <br />
        Under the Plan, subject to the limitations of applicable law and
        regulations, the Fund is authorized to compensate the Distributor up to
        the maximum amount to finance any activity primarily intended to result
        in the sale of Creation Units of the Fund or for providing, or arranging
        for others to provide, shareholder services and for the maintenance of
        shareholder accounts. Such activities may include, but are not limited
        to:
        <sup>(1)</sup> delivering copies of the Fund�s then current reports,
        prospectuses, notices, and similar materials, to prospective purchasers
        of Creation Units; <sup>(2)</sup> marketing and promotional services,
        including advertising; <sup>(3)</sup> paying the costs of and
        compensating others, including Authorized Participants with whom the
        Distributor has entered into written Authorized Participant Agreements,
        for performing shareholder servicing on behalf of the Fund;
        <sup>(4)</sup> compensating certain Authorized Participants for
        providing assistance in distributing the Creation Units of the Fund,
        including the travel and communication expenses and salaries and/or
        commissions of sales personnel in connection with the distribution of
        the Creation Units of the Fund; <sup>(5)</sup> payments to financial
        institutions and intermediaries such as banks, savings and loan
        associations, insurance companies, and investment counselors,
        broker-dealers, mutual fund supermarkets, and the affiliates and
        subsidiaries of the Trust�s service providers as compensation for
        services or reimbursement of expenses incurred in connection with
        distribution assistance; <sup>(6)</sup> facilitating communications with
        beneficial owners of Shares, including the cost of providing, or paying
        others to provide, services to beneficial owners of Shares, including,
        but not limited to, assistance in answering inquiries related to
        Shareholder accounts; and <sup>(7)</sup> such other services and
        obligations as are set forth in the Distribution Agreement.

        <h3>DESCRIPTION OF SHARES</h3>
        The Third Amended and Restated Declaration of Trust (�Declaration of
        Trust�) authorizes the issuance of an unlimited number of funds and
        shares. Each share represents an equal proportionate interest in the
        Fund with each other share. Shares are entitled upon liquidation to a
        pro rata share in the net assets of the Fund. Shareholders have no
        preemptive rights. The Declaration of Trust provides that the Trustees
        may create additional series or classes of shares. All consideration
        received by the Trust for shares of any additional funds and all assets
        in which such consideration is invested would belong to that fund and
        would be subject to the liabilities related thereto. Share certificates
        representing Shares will not be issued. Shares, when issued, are fully
        paid and non-assessable.
        <br />
        <br />
        Each Share has one vote with respect to matters upon which a shareholder
        vote is required, consistent with the requirements of the 1940 Act and
        the rules promulgated thereunder. Shares of all funds in the Trust vote
        together as a single class, except that if the matter being voted on
        affects only a particular fund it will be voted on only by that fund and
        if a matter affects a particular fund differently from other funds, that
        fund will vote separately on such matter. As a Delaware statutory trust,
        the Trust is not required, and does not intend, to hold annual meetings
        of shareholders. Approval of shareholders will be sought, however, for
        certain changes in the operation of the Trust and for the election of
        Trustees under certain circumstances. The Trust will call for a meeting
        of shareholders to consider the removal of one or more Trustees and
        other certain matters upon the written request of shareholders holding
        at least a majority of the outstanding shares of the Trust entitled to
        vote at such meeting. In the event that such a meeting is requested, the
        Trust will provide appropriate assistance and information to the
        shareholders requesting the meeting.
        <br />
        <br />
        Under the Declaration of Trust, the Trustees have the power to liquidate
        the Fund without shareholder approval. While the Trustees have no
        present intention of exercising this power, they may do so if the Fund
        fails to reach a viable size within a reasonable amount of time or for
        such other reasons as may be determined by the Board.

        <h3>LIMITATION OF TRUSTEES� LIABILITY</h3>
        The Declaration of Trust provides that a Trustee shall be liable only
        for his or her own willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence, or
        reckless disregard of the duties involved in the conduct of the office
        of Trustee, and shall not be liable for errors of judgment or mistakes
        of fact or law. The Declaration of Trust also provides that the Trust
        shall indemnify each person who is, or has been, a Trustee or officer of
        the Trust, and upon the due approval of the Trustees, each person who
        is, or has been an employee or agent of the Trust, and, upon due
        approval of the Trustees, any person who is serving or has served at the
        Trust�s request as a director, officer, partner, trustee, employee,
        agent, or fiduciary of another organization with respect to any alleged
        acts or omissions while acting within the scope of a Trustee�s service
        in such a position. However, nothing in the Declaration of Trust shall
        protect or indemnify a Trustee against any liability for a Trustee�s
        willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence, or reckless disregard
        of the duties involved in the conduct of the office of Trustee. Nothing
        contained in this section attempts to disclaim a Trustee�s individual
        liability in any manner inconsistent with the federal securities laws.

        <h3>BROKERAGE TRANSACTIONS</h3>
        The policy of the Trust regarding purchases and sales of securities for
        the Fund is that primary consideration will be given to obtaining the
        most favorable prices and efficient executions of transactions.
        Consistent with this policy, when securities transactions are effected
        on a stock exchange, the Trust�s policy is to pay commissions which are
        considered fair and reasonable without necessarily determining that the
        lowest possible commissions are paid in all circumstances. The Trust
        believes that a requirement always to seek the lowest possible
        commission cost could impede effective portfolio management and preclude
        the Fund and the Adviser from obtaining a high quality of brokerage and
        research services. In seeking to determine the reasonableness of
        brokerage commissions paid in any transaction, the Adviser will rely
        upon their experience and knowledge regarding commissions generally
        charged by various brokers and on its judgment in evaluating the
        brokerage services received from the broker effecting the transaction.
        Such determinations are necessarily subjective and imprecise, as in most
        cases, an exact dollar value for those services is not ascertainable.
        The Trust has adopted policies and procedures that prohibit the
        consideration of sales of Shares as a factor in the selection of a
        broker or dealer to execute its portfolio transactions.
        <br />
        <br />
        The Adviser owes a fiduciary duty to its clients to seek to provide best
        execution on trades effected. In selecting a broker/dealer for each
        specific transaction, the Adviser chooses the broker/dealer deemed most
        capable of providing the services necessary to obtain the most favorable
        execution. �Best execution� is generally understood to mean the most
        favorable cost or net proceeds reasonably obtainable under the
        circumstances. The full range of brokerage services applicable to a
        particular transaction may be considered when making this judgment,
        which may include, but is not limited to liquidity, price, commission,
        timing, aggregated trades, capable floor brokers or traders, competent
        block trading coverage, ability to position, capital strength and
        stability, reliable and accurate communications and settlement
        processing, use of automation, knowledge of other buyers or sellers,
        arbitrage skills, administrative ability, underwriting, and provision of
        information on a particular security or market in which the transaction
        is to occur. The specific criteria will vary depending upon the nature
        of the transaction, the market in which it is executed, and the extent
        to which it is possible to select from among multiple broker/ dealers.
        The Adviser will also use electronic crossing networks (�ECNs�) when
        appropriate.
        <br />
        <br />
        Subject to the foregoing policies, brokers or dealers selected to
        execute the Fund�s portfolio transactions may include the Fund�s
        Authorized Participants (as discussed in �Purchase and Redemption of
        Shares in Creation Units � Procedures for Purchase of Creation Units�
        below) or their affiliates. An Authorized Participant or its affiliates
        may be selected to execute the Fund�s portfolio transactions in
        conjunction with an all-cash Creation Unit order or an order including
        �cash-in-lieu� (as described below under �Purchase and Redemption of
        Shares in Creation Units�), so long as such selection is in keeping with
        the foregoing policies. As described below under �Purchase and
        Redemption of Shares in Creation Units � Creation Transaction Fee� and �
        � Redemption Transaction Fee�, the Fund may determine to not charge a
        variable fee on certain orders when the Adviser has determined that
        doing so is in the best interests of the Fund�s shareholders, even if
        the decision to not charge a variable fee could be viewed as benefiting
        the Authorized Participant or its affiliate selected to execute the
        Fund�s portfolio transactions in connection with such orders.
        <br />
        <br />
        The Adviser may use the Fund�s assets for, or participate in,
        third-party soft dollar arrangements, in addition to receiving
        proprietary research from various full-service brokers, the cost of
        which is bundled with the cost of the broker�s execution services. The
        Adviser does not �pay up� for the value of any such proprietary
        research. Section 28(e) of the 1934 Act permits the Adviser, under
        certain circumstances, to cause the Fund to pay a broker or dealer a
        commission for effecting a transaction in excess of the amount of
        commission another broker or dealer would have charged for effecting the
        transaction in recognition of the value of brokerage and research
        services provided by the broker or dealer. The Adviser may receive a
        variety of research services and information on many topics, which it
        can use in connection with its management responsibilities with respect
        to the various accounts over which it exercises investment discretion or
        otherwise provides investment advice. The research services may include
        qualifying order management systems, portfolio attribution and
        monitoring services, and computer software and access charges which are
        directly related to investment research.
        <br />
        <br />
        Accordingly, the Fund may pay a broker commission higher than the lowest
        available in recognition of the broker�s provision of such services to
        the Adviser, but only if the Adviser determines the total commission
        (including the soft dollar benefit) is comparable to the best commission
        rate that could be expected to be received from other brokers. The
        amount of soft dollar benefits received depends on the amount of
        brokerage transactions effected with the brokers. A conflict of interest
        exists because there is an incentive to <sup>(1)</sup> cause clients to
        pay a higher commission than the firm might otherwise be able to
        negotiate, <sup>(2)</sup> cause clients to engage in more securities
        transactions than would otherwise be optimal, and <sup>(3)</sup> only
        recommend brokers that provide soft dollar benefits.
        <br />
        <br />
        The Adviser faces a potential conflict of interest when it uses client
        trades to obtain brokerage or research services. This conflict exists
        because the Adviser can use the brokerage or research services to manage
        client accounts without paying cash for such services, which reduces the
        Adviser�s expenses to the extent that the Adviser would have purchased
        such products had they not been provided by brokers. Section 28(e)
        permits the Adviser to use brokerage or research services for the
        benefit of any account it manages. Certain accounts managed by the
        Adviser may generate soft dollars used to purchase brokerage or research
        services that ultimately benefit other accounts managed by the Adviser
        effectively cross subsidizing the other accounts managed by the Adviser
        that benefit directly from the product. The Adviser may not necessarily
        use all of the brokerage or research services in connection with
        managing the Fund whose trades generated the soft dollars used to
        purchase such products.
        <br />
        <br />
        The Adviser is responsible, subject to oversight by the Board, for
        placing orders on behalf of the Fund for the purchase or sale of
        portfolio securities. If purchases or sales of portfolio securities of
        the Fund and one or more other investment companies or clients
        supervised by the Adviser are considered at or about the same time,
        transactions in such securities are allocated among the several
        investment companies and clients in a manner deemed equitable and
        consistent with its fiduciary obligations to all by the Adviser. In some
        cases, this procedure could have a detrimental effect on the price or
        volume of the security so far as the Fund is concerned. However, in
        other cases, it is possible that the ability to participate in volume
        transactions and to negotiate lower brokerage commissions will be
        beneficial to the Fund. The primary consideration is prompt execution of
        orders at the most favorable net price.
        <br />
        <br />
        The Fund may deal with affiliates in principal transactions to the
        extent permitted by exemptive order or applicable rule or regulation.
        <br />
        <br />
        The Fund is new and has not paid any brokerage commissions as of the
        date of this SAI.
        <br />
        <br />
        Brokerage with Fund Affiliates. The Fund may execute brokerage or other
        agency transactions through registered broker-dealer affiliates of the
        Fund or the Adviser for a commission in conformity with the 1940 Act,
        the 1934 Act and rules promulgated by the SEC. These rules require that
        commissions paid to the affiliate by the Fund for exchange transactions
        not exceed �usual and customary� brokerage commissions. The rules define
        �usual and customary� commissions to include amounts which are
        �reasonable and fair compared to the commission, fee or other
        remuneration received or to be received by other brokers in connection
        with comparable transactions involving similar securities being
        purchased or sold on a securities exchange during a comparable period of
        time.� The Trustees, including those who are not �interested persons� of
        the Fund, have adopted procedures for evaluating the reasonableness of
        commissions paid to affiliates and review these procedures periodically.
        <br />
        <br />
        The Fund is required to identify the securities of their �regular
        brokers or dealers� that the Fund has acquired during its most recent
        fiscal year. The Fund is new and did not own equity securities of its
        regular broker-dealers or their parent companies as of the date of this
        SAI.
        <br />
        <br />
        Directed Brokerage
        <br />
        <br />
        The Fund is new and has not pay any commissions on brokerage
        transactions directed to brokers pursuant to an agreement or
        understanding whereby the broker provides research or other brokerage
        services to the Adviser.
        <br />
        <br />
        Securities of �Regular Broker-Dealers.� The Fund is required to identify
        any securities of its �regular brokers and dealers� (as such term is
        defined in the 1940 Act) that it may hold at the close of its most
        recent fiscal year. �Regular brokers or dealers� of the Fund are the ten
        brokers or dealers that, during the most recent fiscal year:
        <sup>(1)</sup> received the greatest dollar amounts of brokerage
        commissions from the Fund�s portfolio transactions;
        <sup>(2)</sup> engaged as principal in the largest dollar amounts of
        portfolio transactions of the Fund; or <sup>(3)</sup> sold the largest
        dollar amounts of Shares.
        <br />
        <br />
        The Fund is new and did not own equity securities of its regular
        broker-dealers or their parent companies as of the date of this SAI.

        <h3>PORTFOLIO TURNOVER RATE</h3>
        A portfolio turnover rate is, in summary, the percentage computed by
        dividing the lesser of the Fund�s purchases or sales of securities
        (excluding short-term securities and securities transferred in-kind) by
        the average market value of the Fund. A rate of 100% indicates that the
        equivalent of all of the Fund�s assets have been sold and reinvested in
        a year. High portfolio turnover may affect the amount, timing and
        character of distributions, and, as a result, may increase the amount of
        taxes payable by shareholders. Higher portfolio turnover also results in
        higher transaction costs. To the extent that net short-term capital
        gains are realized by the Fund, any distributions resulting from such
        gains are considered ordinary income for federal income tax purposes.
        <br />
        <br />
        The Fund is new and does not have a portfolio turnover rate to report as

        <h3>BOOK ENTRY ONLY SYSTEM</h3>
        The Depository Trust Company (�DTC�) acts as securities depositary for
        Shares. Shares are represented by securities registered in the name of
        DTC or its nominee, Cede &amp; Co., and deposited with, or on behalf of,
        DTC. Except in limited circumstances set forth below, certificates will
        not be issued for Shares.
        <br />
        <br />
        DTC is a limited-purpose trust company that was created to hold
        securities of its participants (the �DTC Participants�) and to
        facilitate the clearance and settlement of securities transactions among
        the DTC Participants in such securities through electronic book-entry
        changes in accounts of the DTC Participants, thereby eliminating the
        need for physical movement of securities certificates. DTC Participants
        include securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies, clearing
        corporations and certain other organizations, some of whom (and/or their
        representatives) own DTC. More specifically, DTC is owned by a number of
        its DTC Participants and by the New York Stock Exchange (�NYSE�) and
        FINRA. Access to the DTC system is also available to others such as
        banks, brokers, dealers, and trust companies that clear through or
        maintain a custodial relationship with a DTC Participant, either
        directly or indirectly (the �Indirect Participants�).
        <br />
        <br />
        Beneficial ownership of Shares is limited to DTC Participants, Indirect
        Participants, and persons holding interests through DTC Participants and
        Indirect Participants. Ownership of beneficial interests in Shares
        (owners of such beneficial interests are referred to in this SAI as
        �Beneficial Owners�) is shown on, and the transfer of ownership is
        effected only through, records maintained by DTC (with respect to DTC
        Participants) and on the records of DTC Participants (with respect to
        Indirect Participants and Beneficial Owners that are not DTC
        Participants). Beneficial Owners will receive from or through the DTC
        Participant a written confirmation relating to their purchase of Shares.
        The Trust recognizes DTC or its nominee as the record owner of all
        Shares for all purposes. Beneficial Owners of Shares are not entitled to
        have Shares registered in their names, and will not receive or be
        entitled to physical delivery of Share certificates. Each Beneficial
        Owner must rely on the procedures of DTC and any DTC Participant and/or
        Indirect Participant through which such Beneficial Owner holds its
        interests, to exercise any rights of a holder of Shares.
        <br />
        <br />
        Conveyance of all notices, statements, and other communications to
        Beneficial Owners is effected as follows. DTC will make available to the
        Trust upon request and for a fee a listing of Shares held by each DTC
        Participant. The Trust shall obtain from each such DTC Participant the
        number of Beneficial Owners holding Shares, directly or indirectly,
        through such DTC Participant. The Trust shall provide each such DTC
        Participant with copies of such notice, statement, or other
        communication, in such form, number, and at such place as such DTC
        Participant may reasonably request, in order that such notice,
        statement, or communication may be transmitted by such DTC Participant,
        directly or indirectly, to such Beneficial Owners. In addition, the
        Trust shall pay to each such DTC Participant a fair and reasonable
        amount as reimbursement for the expenses attendant to such transmittal,
        all subject to applicable statutory and regulatory requirements.
        <br />
        <br />
        Share distributions shall be made to DTC or its nominee, Cede &amp; Co.,
        as the registered holder of all Shares. DTC or its nominee, upon receipt
        of any such distributions, shall credit immediately DTC Participants�
        accounts with payments in amounts proportionate to their respective
        beneficial interests in the Fund as shown on the records of DTC or its
        nominee. Payments by DTC Participants to Indirect Participants and
        Beneficial Owners of Shares held through such DTC Participants will be
        governed by standing instructions and customary practices, as is now the
        case with securities held for the accounts of customers in bearer form
        or registered in a �street name,� and will be the responsibility of such
        DTC Participants.
        <br />
        <br />
        The Trust has no responsibility or liability for any aspect of the
        records relating to or notices to Beneficial Owners, or payments made on
        account of beneficial ownership interest in Shares, or for maintaining,
        supervising, or reviewing any records relating to such beneficial
        ownership interests, or for any other aspect of the relationship between
        DTC and the DTC Participants or the relationship between such DTC
        Participants and the Indirect Participants and Beneficial Owners owning
        through such DTC Participants.
        <br />
        <br />
        DTC may determine to discontinue providing its service with respect to
        the Fund at any time by giving reasonable notice to the Fund and
        discharging its responsibilities with respect thereto under applicable
        law. Under such circumstances, the Fund shall act either to find a
        replacement for DTC to perform its functions at a comparable cost or, if
        such replacement is unavailable, to issue and deliver printed
        certificates representing ownership of Shares, unless the Trust makes
        other arrangements with respect thereto satisfactory to the Exchange.

        <h3>PURCHASE AND REDEMPTION OF SHARES IN CREATION UNITS</h3>
        The Trust issues and redeems Shares only in Creation Units on a
        continuous basis through the Transfer Agent, without a sales load (but
        subject to transaction fees, if applicable), at their NAV per share next
        determined after receipt of an order, on any Business Day, in proper
        form pursuant to the terms of the Authorized Participant Agreement
        (�Participant Agreement�). The NAV of Shares is calculated each Business
        Day as of the scheduled close of regular trading on the NYSE, generally
        4:00 p.m., Eastern Time. The Fund will not issue fractional Creation
        Units. A �Business Day� is any day on which the NYSE is open for regular
        trading.
        <br />
        <br />
        Fund Deposit. The consideration for purchase of a Creation Unit of the
        Fund generally consists of the in-kind deposit of a designated portfolio
        of securities (the �Deposit Securities�) per each Creation Unit and the
        Cash Component (defined below), computed as described below.
        Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Trust reserves the right to permit or
        require the substitution of a �cash in lieu� amount (�Deposit Cash�) to
        be added to the Cash Component to replace any Deposit Security. When
        accepting purchases of Creation Units for all or a portion of Deposit
        Cash, the Fund may incur additional costs associated with the
        acquisition of Deposit Securities that would otherwise be provided by an
        in-kind purchaser.

        <br />

        <br />

        Together, the Deposit Securities or Deposit Cash, as applicable, and the
        Cash Component constitute the �Fund Deposit,� which represents the
        minimum initial and subsequent investment amount for a Creation Unit of
        the Fund. The �Cash Component� is an amount equal to the difference
        between the NAV of Shares (per Creation Unit) and the value of the
        Deposit Securities or Deposit Cash, as applicable. If the Cash Component
        is a positive number (i.e., the NAV per Creation Unit exceeds the value
        of the Deposit Securities or Deposit Cash, as applicable), the Cash
        Component shall be such positive amount. If the Cash Component is a
        negative number (i.e., the NAV per Creation Unit is less than the value
        of the Deposit Securities or Deposit Cash, as applicable), the Cash
        Component shall be such negative amount and the creator will be entitled
        to receive cash in an amount equal to the Cash Component. The Cash
        Component serves the function of compensating for any differences
        between the NAV per Creation Unit and the value of the Deposit
        Securities or Deposit Cash, as applicable. Computation of the Cash
        Component excludes any stamp duty or other similar fees and expenses
        payable upon transfer of beneficial ownership of the Deposit Securities,
        if applicable, which shall be the sole responsibility of the Authorized
        Participant (as defined below).
        <br />
        <br />
        The Fund, through NSCC, makes available on each Business Day, prior to
        the opening of business on the Exchange (currently 9:30 a.m., Eastern
        Time), the list of the names and the required number of Shares of each
        Deposit Security or the required amount of Deposit Cash, as applicable,
        to be included in the current Fund Deposit (based on information at the
        end of the previous Business Day) for the Fund. Such Fund Deposit is
        subject to any applicable adjustments as described below, to effect
        purchases of Creation Units of the Fund until such time as the
        next-announced composition of the Deposit Securities or the required
        amount of Deposit Cash, as applicable, is made available.
        <br />
        <br />
        The identity and number of Shares of the Deposit Securities or the
        amount of Deposit Cash, as applicable, required for the Fund Deposit for
        the Fund may change from time to time.
        <br />
        <br />
        Procedures for Purchase of Creation Units. To be eligible to place
        orders with the Transfer Agent to purchase a Creation Unit of the Fund,
        an entity must be <sup>(i)</sup> a �Participating Party� (i.e., a
        broker-dealer or other participant in the clearing process through the
        Continuous Net Settlement System of the NSCC (the �Clearing Process�)),
        a clearing agency that is registered with the SEC; or <sup>(ii)</sup> a
        DTC Participant (see �Book Entry Only System�). In addition, each
        Participating Party or DTC Participant (each, an �Authorized
        Participant�) must execute a Participant Agreement with respect to
        purchases and redemptions of Creation Units. Each Authorized Participant
        will agree, pursuant to the terms of a Participant Agreement, on behalf
        of itself or any investor on whose behalf it will act, to certain
        conditions, including that it will pay to the Trust, an amount of cash
        sufficient to pay the Cash Component together with the creation
        transaction fee (described below), if applicable, and any other
        applicable fees and taxes.
        <br />
        <br />
        All orders to purchase Shares directly from the Fund must be placed for
        one or more Creation Units and in the manner and by the time set forth
        in the Participant Agreement and/or applicable order form. The order
        cut-off time for orders to purchase Creation Units is expected to be
        [4:00 p.m.] Eastern Time, which time may be modified by the Fund from
        time-to-time by amendment to the Participant Agreement and/or applicable
        order form. The date on which an order to purchase Creation Units (or an
        order to redeem Creation Units, as set forth below) is received and
        accepted is referred to as the �Order Placement Date.�
        <br />
        <br />
        An Authorized Participant may require an investor to make certain
        representations or enter into agreements with respect to the order
        (e.g., to provide for payments of cash, when required). Investors should
        be aware that their particular broker may not have executed a
        Participant Agreement and that, therefore, orders to purchase Shares
        directly from the Fund in Creation Units must be placed by the
        investor�s broker through an Authorized Participant that has executed a
        Participant Agreement. In such cases there may be additional charges to
        such investor. At any given time, there may be only a limited number of
        broker-dealers that have executed a Participant Agreement and only a
        small number of such Authorized Participants may have international
        capabilities.
        <br />
        <br />
        On days when the Exchange closes earlier than normal, the Fund may
        require orders to create Creation Units to be placed earlier in the day.
        In addition, if a market or markets on which the Fund�s investments are
        primarily traded is closed, the Fund will also generally not accept
        orders on such day(s). Orders must be transmitted by an Authorized
        Participant by telephone or other transmission method acceptable to the
        Transfer Agent pursuant to procedures set forth in the Participant
        Agreement and in accordance with the applicable order form. On behalf of
        the Fund, the Transfer Agent will notify the Custodian of such order.
        The Custodian will then provide such information to the appropriate
        local sub-custodian(s). Those placing orders through an Authorized
        Participant should allow sufficient time to permit proper submission of
        the purchase order to the Transfer Agent by the cut-off time on such
        Business Day. Economic or market disruptions or changes, or telephone or
        other communication failure may impede the ability to reach the Transfer
        Agent or an Authorized Participant.
        <br />
        <br />
        Fund Deposits must be delivered by an Authorized Participant through the
        Federal Reserve System (for cash) or through DTC (for corporate
        securities), through a subcustody agent (for foreign securities) and/or
        through such other arrangements allowed by the Trust or its agents. With
        respect to foreign Deposit Securities, the Custodian shall cause the
        subcustodian of the Fund to maintain an account into which the
        Authorized Participant shall deliver, on behalf of itself or the party
        on whose behalf it is acting, such Deposit Securities (or Deposit Cash
        for all or a part of such securities, as permitted or required), with
        any appropriate adjustments as advised by the Trust. Foreign Deposit
        Securities must be delivered to an account maintained at the applicable
        local subcustodian. A Fund Deposit transfer must be ordered by the
        Authorized Participant in a timely fashion to ensure the delivery of the
        requisite number of Deposit Securities or Deposit Cash, as applicable,
        to the account of the Fund or its agents by no later than [4:00 p.m.]
        Eastern Time for the Fund (or such other time as specified by the Trust)
        on the contractual settlement date. If the Fund or its agents do not
        receive all of the Deposit Securities, or the required Deposit Cash in
        lieu thereof, by such time, then the order may be deemed rejected and
        the Authorized Participant shall be liable to the Fund for losses, if
        any, resulting therefrom. All questions as to the number of Deposit
        Securities or Deposit Cash to be delivered, as applicable, and the
        validity, form and eligibility (including time of receipt) for the
        deposit of any tendered securities or cash, as applicable, will be
        determined by the Trust, whose determination shall be final and binding.
        The amount of cash represented by the Cash Component must be transferred
        directly to the Custodian through the Federal Reserve Bank wire transfer
        system in a timely manner to be received by the Custodian no later than
        the contractual settlement date. If the Cash Component and the Deposit
        Securities or Deposit Cash, as applicable, are not received by the
        Custodian in a timely manner by the contractual settlement date, the
        creation order may be cancelled. Upon written notice to the Transfer
        Agent, such canceled order may be resubmitted the following Business Day
        using a Fund Deposit as newly constituted to reflect the then current
        NAV of the Fund.
        <br />
        <br />
        The order shall be deemed to be received on the Business Day on which
        the order is placed provided that the order is placed in proper form
        prior to the applicable cut-off time and the federal funds in the
        appropriate amount are deposited by [4:00 p.m.] Eastern Time for the
        Fund, with the Custodian on the contractual settlement date. If the
        order is not placed in proper form as required, or federal funds in the
        appropriate amount are not received by [4:00 p.m.] Eastern Time for the
        Fund on the contractual settlement date, then the order may be deemed to
        be rejected and the Authorized Participant shall be liable to the Fund
        for losses, if any, resulting therefrom. A creation request is in
        �proper form� if all procedures set forth in the Participant Agreement,
        order form and this SAI are properly followed.
        <br />
        <br />
        Issuance of a Creation Unit. Except as provided in this SAI, Creation
        Units will not be issued until the transfer of good title to the Trust
        of the Deposit Securities or payment of Deposit Cash, as applicable, and
        the payment of the Cash Component have been completed. When the required
        Deposit Securities (or the cash value thereof) have been delivered to
        the account of the Custodian (or sub-custodian, as applicable), the
        Transfer Agent and the Adviser shall be notified of such delivery, and
        the Trust will issue and cause the delivery of the Creation Units. The
        typical settlement date for each transaction will be within one day of
        the transaction (commonly referred to as �T+1�), unless the Fund and
        Authorized Participant agree to a different timeline for settlement or
        the transaction is exempt from the requirements of Rule 15c6-1 under the
        1934 Act. Due to the schedule of holidays in certain countries, however,
        the delivery of Shares may take longer than one Business Day following
        the day on which the purchase order is received. In such cases, the
        local market settlement procedures will not commence until the end of
        local holiday periods. The Authorized Participant shall be liable to the
        Fund for losses, if any, resulting from unsettled orders.
        <br />
        <br />
        Creation Units may be purchased in advance of receipt by the Trust of
        all or a portion of the applicable Deposit Securities as described
        below. In these circumstances, the initial deposit will have a value
        greater than the NAV of the Shares on the date the order is placed in
        proper form since, in addition to available Deposit Securities, cash
        must be deposited in an amount equal to the sum of <sup>(i)</sup> the
        Cash Component, plus <sup>(ii)</sup> an additional amount of cash equal
        to a percentage of the value as set forth in the Participant Agreement,
        of the undelivered Deposit Securities (the �Additional Cash Deposit�),
        which shall be maintained in a separate non-interest bearing collateral
        account. The Authorized Participant must deposit with the Custodian the
        Additional Cash Deposit, as applicable, by [4:00 p.m.] Eastern Time for
        the Fund (or such other time as specified by the Trust) on the
        contractual settlement date. If the Fund or its agents do not receive
        the Additional Cash Deposit in the appropriate amount, by such time,
        then the order may be deemed rejected and the Authorized Participant
        shall be liable to the Fund for losses, if any, resulting therefrom. An
        additional amount of cash shall be required to be deposited with the
        Trust, pending delivery of the missing Deposit Securities to the extent
        necessary to maintain the Additional Cash Deposit with the Trust in an
        amount at least equal to the applicable percentage, as set forth in the
        Participant Agreement, of the daily market value of the missing Deposit
        Securities. The Participant Agreement will permit the Trust to buy the
        missing Deposit Securities at any time. Authorized Participants will be
        liable to the Trust for the costs incurred by the Trust in connection
        with any such purchases. These costs will be deemed to include the
        amount by which the actual purchase price of the Deposit Securities
        exceeds the value of such Deposit Securities on the day the purchase
        order was deemed received by the Transfer Agent plus the brokerage and
        related transaction costs associated with such purchases. The Trust will
        return any unused portion of the Additional Cash Deposit once all of the
        missing Deposit Securities have been properly received by the Custodian
        or purchased by the Trust and deposited into the Trust. In addition, a
        transaction fee, as described below under �Creation Transaction Fee,�
        may be charged. The delivery of Creation Units so created generally will
        occur no later than the contractual settlement date.

        <br />
        <br />

        Acceptance of Orders of Creation Units. The Trust reserves the right to
        reject an order for Creation Units transmitted to it by the Transfer
        Agent with respect to the Fund including if <sup>(1)</sup> the order is
        not in proper form; <sup>(2)</sup> the Deposit Securities or Deposit
        Cash, as applicable, delivered by the Authorized Participant are not as
        disseminated through the facilities of the NSCC for that date by the
        Custodian; <sup>(3)</sup> the investor(s), upon obtaining Shares
        ordered, would own 80% or more of the currently outstanding Shares;
        <sup>(4)</sup> the acceptance of the Fund Deposit would, in the opinion
        of counsel, be unlawful; <sup>(5)</sup> the acceptance or receipt of the
        order for a Creation Unit would, in the opinion of counsel to the Trust,
        be unlawful; or <sup>(6)</sup> in the event that circumstances outside
        the control of the Trust, the Custodian, the Transfer Agent and/or the
        Adviser make it for all practical purposes not feasible to process
        orders for Creation Units.
        <br />
        <br />
        Examples of such circumstances include acts of God; public service or
        utility problems such as fires, floods, extreme weather conditions, and
        power outages resulting in telephone, telecopy, and computer failures;
        market conditions or activities causing trading halts; systems failures
        involving computer or other information systems affecting the Trust, the
        Distributor, the Custodian, a sub-custodian, the Transfer Agent, DTC,
        NSCC, Federal Reserve System, or any other participant in the creation
        process; and other extraordinary events. The Transfer Agent shall notify
        a prospective creator of a Creation Unit and/or the Authorized
        Participant acting on behalf of the creator of a Creation Unit of its
        rejection of the order of such person. The Trust, the Transfer Agent,
        the Custodian, any sub-custodian and the Distributor are under no duty,
        however, to give notification of any defects or irregularities in the
        delivery of Fund Deposits nor shall either of them incur any liability
        for the failure to give any such notification. The Trust, the Transfer
        Agent, the Custodian and the Distributor shall not be liable for the
        rejection of any purchase order for Creation Units.
        <br />
        <br />
        All questions as to the number of Shares of each security in the Deposit
        Securities and the validity, form, eligibility, and acceptance for
        deposit of any securities to be delivered shall be determined by the
        Trust, and the Trust�s determination shall be final and binding.
        <br />
        <br />
        Notwithstanding the Trust�s ability to reject an order for creation
        units, the Trust will only do so in a manner consistent with Rule 6c-11
        under the 1940 Act, and SEC guidance relating thereto, including the
        ability of the Trust to suspend orders only in limited times and
        extraordinary circumstances. Additionally, a suspension of creation
        units by the Trust, on behalf of the Fund, will not impair the arbitrage
        mechanism for investors.
        <br />
        <br />
        Creation Transaction Fee. A fixed purchase (i.e., creation) transaction
        fee, payable to the Custodian, may be imposed for the transfer and other
        transaction costs associated with the purchase of Creation Units
        (�Creation Order Costs�). The standard fixed creation transaction fee
        for the Fund, regardless of the number of Creation Units created in the
        transaction, can be found in the table below. The Fund may adjust the
        standard fixed creation transaction fee from time to time. The fixed
        creation fee may be waived on certain orders if the Custodian has
        determined to waive some or all of the Creation Order Costs associated
        with the order or another party, such as the Adviser, has agreed to pay
        such fee.
        <br />
        <br />
        In addition, a variable fee, payable to the Fund, of up to the maximum
        percentage listed in the table below of the value of the Creation Units
        subject to the transaction may be imposed for cash purchases,
        non-standard orders, or partial cash purchases of Creation Units. The
        variable charge is primarily designed to cover additional costs (e.g.,
        brokerage, taxes) involved with buying the securities with cash. The
        Fund may determine to not charge a variable fee on certain orders when
        the Adviser has determined that doing so is in the best interests of
        Fund shareholders.

        Investors who use the services of a broker or other such intermediary
        may be charged a fee for such services. Investors are responsible for
        the fixed costs of transferring the Fund Securities (defined below) from
        the Trust to their account or on their order.
        <br />
        <br />
        Risks of Purchasing Creation Units. There are certain legal risks unique
        to investors purchasing Creation Units directly from the Fund. Because
        Shares may be issued on an ongoing basis, a �distribution� of Shares
        could be occurring at any time. Certain activities that a shareholder
        performs as a dealer could, depending on the circumstances, result in
        the shareholder being deemed a participant in the distribution in a
        manner that could render the shareholder a statutory underwriter and
        subject to the prospectus delivery and liability provisions of the
        Securities Act. For example, a shareholder could be deemed a statutory
        underwriter if it purchases Creation Units from the Fund, breaks them
        down into the constituent Shares, and sells those Shares directly to
        customers, or if a shareholder chooses to couple the creation of a
        supply of new Shares with an active selling effort involving
        solicitation of secondary-market demand for Shares. Whether a person is
        an underwriter depends upon all of the facts and circumstances
        pertaining to that person�s activities, and the examples mentioned here
        should not be considered a complete description of all the activities
        that could cause you to be deemed an underwriter.
        <br />
        <br />
        Dealers who are not �underwriters� but are participating in a
        distribution (as opposed to engaging in ordinary secondary-market
        transactions), and thus dealing with Shares as part of an �unsold
        allotment� within the meaning of Section 4(a)(3)(C) of the Securities
        Act, will be unable to take advantage of the prospectus delivery
        exemption provided by Section 4(a)(3) of the Securities Act.

        <br />
        <br />
        <h3>Redemption.</h3>
        Shares may be redeemed only in Creation Units at their NAV next
        determined after receipt of a redemption request in proper form by the
        Fund through the Transfer Agent and only on a Business Day. EXCEPT UPON
        LIQUIDATION OF THE FUND, THE TRUST WILL NOT REDEEM SHARES IN AMOUNTS
        LESS THAN CREATION UNITS. Investors must accumulate enough Shares in the
        secondary market to constitute a Creation Unit to have such Shares
        redeemed by the Trust. There can be no assurance, however, that there
        will be sufficient liquidity in the public trading market at any time to
        permit assembly of a Creation Unit. Investors should expect to incur
        brokerage and other costs in connection with assembling a sufficient
        number of Shares to constitute a redeemable Creation Unit.
        <br />
        <br />
        With respect to the Fund, the Custodian, through the NSCC, makes
        available prior to the opening of business on the Exchange (currently
        9:30 a.m., Eastern Time) on each Business Day, the list of the names and
        Share quantities of the Fund�s portfolio securities that will be
        applicable (subject to possible amendment or correction) to redemption
        requests received in proper form (as defined below) on that day (�Fund
        Securities�). Fund Securities received on redemption may not be
        identical to Deposit Securities.
        <br />
        <br />
        Redemption proceeds for a Creation Unit are paid either in-kind or in
        cash, or combination thereof, as determined by the Trust. With respect
        to in-kind redemptions of the Fund, redemption proceeds for a Creation
        Unit will consist of Fund Securities�as announced by the Custodian on
        the Business Day of the request for redemption received in proper form
        plus cash in an amount equal to the difference between the NAV of Shares
        being redeemed, as next determined after a receipt of a request in
        proper form, and the value of the Fund Securities (the �Cash Redemption
        Amount�), less a fixed redemption transaction fee, as applicable, as set
        forth below. If the Fund Securities have a value greater than the NAV of
        Shares, a compensating cash payment equal to the differential is
        required to be made by or through an Authorized Participant by the
        redeeming shareholder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at the Trust�s
        discretion, an Authorized Participant may receive the corresponding cash
        value of the securities in lieu of the in-kind securities value
        representing one or more Fund Securities.
        <br />
        <br />
        The typical settlement date for each redemption transaction will be
        within one day of the transaction (or T+1), unless the Fund and
        Authorized Participant agree to a different timeline for settlement or
        the transaction is exempt from the requirements of Rule 15c6-1 under the
        1934 Act. Due to the schedule of holidays in certain countries, however,
        the receipt of redemption proceeds may take longer than one Business Day
        following the day on which the purchase order is received. In such
        cases, the local market settlement procedures will not commence until
        the end of local holiday periods.
        <br />
        <br />
        Redemption Transaction Fee. A fixed redemption transaction fee, payable
        to the Custodian, may be imposed for the transfer and other transaction
        costs associated with the redemption of Creation Units (�Redemption
        Order Costs�). The standard fixed redemption transaction fee for the
        Fund, regardless of the number of Creation Units redeemed in the
        transaction, can be found in the table below. The Fund may adjust the
        redemption transaction fee from time to time. The fixed redemption fee
        may be waived on certain orders if the Custodian has determined to waive
        some or all of the Redemption Order Costs associated with the order or
        another party, such as the Adviser, has agreed to pay such fee.
        <br />
        <br />
        In addition, a variable fee, payable to the Fund, of up to the maximum
        percentage listed in the table below of the value of the Creation Units
        subject to the transaction may be imposed for cash redemptions,
        non-standard orders, or partial cash redemptions (when cash redemptions
        are available) of Creation Units. The variable charge is primarily
        designed to cover additional costs (e.g., brokerage, taxes) involved
        with selling portfolio securities to satisfy a cash redemption. The Fund
        may determine to not charge a variable fee on certain orders when the
        Adviser has determined that doing so is in the best interests of Fund
        shareholders.

        Investors who use the services of a broker or other such intermediary
        may be charged a fee for such services. Investors are responsible for
        the fixed costs of transferring the Fund Securities from the Trust to

        <br />
        <br />
        Procedures for Redemption of Creation Units. Orders to redeem Creation
        Units must be submitted in proper form to the Transfer Agent prior to
        [4:00 p.m.] Eastern Time. A redemption request is considered to be in
        �proper form� if <sup>(i)</sup> an Authorized Participant has
        transferred or caused to be transferred to the Trust�s Transfer Agent
        the Creation Unit(s) being redeemed through the book-entry system of DTC
        so as to be effective by the time as set forth in the Participant
        Agreement and <sup>(ii)</sup> a request in form satisfactory to the
        Trust is received by the Transfer Agent from the Authorized Participant
        on behalf of itself or another redeeming investor within the time
        periods specified in the Participant Agreement. If the Transfer Agent
        does not receive the investor�s Shares through DTC�s facilities by the
        times and pursuant to the other terms and conditions set forth in the
        Participant Agreement, the redemption request shall be rejected.
        <br />
        <br />
        The Authorized Participant must transmit the request for redemption, in
        the form required by the Trust, to the Transfer Agent in accordance with
        procedures set forth in the Authorized Participant Agreement. Investors
        should be aware that their particular broker may not have executed an
        Authorized Participant Agreement, and that, therefore, requests to
        redeem Creation Units may have to be placed by the investor�s broker
        through an Authorized Participant who has executed an Authorized
        Participant Agreement. Investors making a redemption request should be
        aware that such request must be in the form specified by such Authorized
        Participant. Investors making a request to redeem Creation Units should
        allow sufficient time to permit proper submission of the request by an
        Authorized Participant and transfer of the Shares to the Trust�s
        Transfer Agent; such investors should allow for the additional time that
        may be required to effect redemptions through their banks, brokers or
        other financial intermediaries if such intermediaries are not Authorized
        Participants.
        <br />
        <br />
        Additional Redemption Procedures. In connection with taking delivery of
        Shares of Fund Securities upon redemption of Creation Units, a redeeming
        shareholder or Authorized Participant acting on behalf of such
        Shareholder must maintain appropriate custody arrangements with a
        qualified broker-dealer, bank, or other custody providers in each
        jurisdiction in which any of the Fund Securities are customarily traded,
        to which account such Fund Securities will be delivered. Deliveries of
        redemption proceeds will generally be made within by the next Business
        Day of the trade date, as discussed above.
        <br />
        <br />
        The Trust may in its discretion exercise its option to cause the Fund to
        redeem such Shares in cash, and the redeeming investor will be required
        to receive its redemption proceeds in cash. In addition, an investor may
        request a redemption in cash that the Fund may, in its sole discretion,
        permit. In either case, the investor will receive a cash payment equal
        to the NAV of its Shares of such Fund based on the NAV of Shares next
        determined after the redemption request is received in proper form
        (minus a redemption transaction fee, if applicable, and additional
        charge for requested cash redemptions specified above, to offset the
        Trust�s brokerage and other transaction costs associated with the
        disposition of Fund Securities). The Fund may also, in its sole
        discretion, upon request of a shareholder, provide such redeemer a
        portfolio of securities that differs from the exact composition of the
        Fund Securities but does not differ in NAV.
        <br />
        <br />
        Redemptions of Shares for Fund Securities will be subject to compliance
        with applicable federal and state securities laws and the Fund (whether
        or not it otherwise permits cash redemptions) reserves the right to
        redeem Creation Units for cash to the extent that the Trust could not
        lawfully deliver specific Fund Securities upon redemptions or could not
        do so without first registering the Fund Securities under such laws. An
        Authorized Participant or an investor for which it is acting subject to
        a legal restriction with respect to a particular security included in
        the Fund Securities applicable to the redemption of Creation Units may
        be paid an equivalent amount of cash. The Authorized Participant may
        request the redeeming investor of the Shares to complete an order form
        or to enter into agreements with respect to such matters as compensating
        cash payment. Further, an Authorized Participant that is not a
        �qualified institutional buyer,� (�QIB�) as such term is defined under
        Rule 144A of the Securities Act, will not be able to receive Fund
        Securities that are restricted securities eligible for resale under Rule
        144A. An Authorized Participant may be required by the Trust to provide
        a written confirmation with respect to QIB status to receive Fund
        Securities.
        <br />
        <br />
        The right of redemption may be suspended or the date of payment
        postponed with respect to the Fund <sup>(1)</sup> for any period during
        which the Exchange is closed (other than customary weekend and holiday
        closings); <sup>(2)</sup> for any period during which trading on the
        Exchange is suspended or restricted; <sup>(3)</sup> for any period
        during which an emergency exists as a result of which disposal of the
        Shares or determination of the NAV of the Shares is not reasonably
        practicable; or <sup>(4)</sup> in such other circumstance as is
        permitted by the SEC.

        <h3>DETERMINATION OF NET ASSET VALUE</h3>
        NAV per Share for the Fund is computed by dividing the value of the net
        assets of the Fund (i.e., the value of its total assets less total
        liabilities) by the total number of Shares outstanding, rounded to the
        nearest cent. Expenses and fees, including the management fees, are
        accrued daily and taken into account for purposes of determining NAV.
        The NAV of the Fund is calculated by Global Fund Services and determined
        at the scheduled close of the regular trading session on the NYSE
        (ordinarily 4:00 p.m., Eastern Time) on each day that the NYSE is open,
        provided that fixed-income assets may be valued as of the announced
        closing time for trading in fixed-income instruments on any day that the
        Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association (�SIFMA�)
        announces an early closing time.
        <br />
        <br />
        In calculating the Fund�s NAV per Share, the Fund�s investments are
        generally valued using market valuations. The Fund may use various
        pricing services, or discontinue the use of any pricing service, as
        approved by the Adviser from time to time. A price obtained from a
        pricing service based on such pricing service�s valuation matrix may be
        considered a market valuation. Any assets or liabilities denominated in
        currencies other than the U.S. dollar are converted into U.S. dollars at
        the current market rates on the date of valuation as quoted by one or
        more sources. For assets traded on an exchange, the Fund may value
        investments using market valuations. A market valuation generally means
        a valuation
        <sup>(1)</sup> obtained from an exchange, a pricing service, or a major
        market maker (or dealer), <sup>(2)</sup> based on a price quotation or
        other equivalent indication of value supplied by an exchange, a pricing
        service, or a major market maker (or dealer) or <sup>(3)</sup> based on
        amortized cost. In the case of shares of other funds that are not traded
        on an exchange, a market valuation means such fund�s published NAV per
        share.
        <br />
        <br />
        When market prices are not �readily available� or are deemed to be
        unreliable, consistent with Rule 2a-5 under the 1940 Act, the Trust and
        the Adviser have adopted procedures and methodologies wherein the
        Adviser, serving as the Fund�s Valuation Designee (as defined in Rule
        2a-5), determines the fair value of Fund investments.

        <h3>DIVIDENDS AND DISTRIBUTIONS</h3>
        The following information supplements and should be read in conjunction
        with the section in the Prospectus entitled �Dividends, Distributions,
        and Taxes.�
        <br />
        <br />
        General Policies. The Fund intends to pay out dividends and interest
        income, if any, annually and distribute any net realized capital gains
        to its shareholders at least annually. Distributions of net realized
        capital gains, if any, generally are declared and paid once a year, but
        the Fund may make distributions on a more frequent basis to comply with
        the distribution requirements of the Code, in all events in a manner
        consistent with the provisions of the 1940 Act.
        <br />
        <br />
        The Fund will declare and pay income and capital gain distributions, if
        any, in cash. Dividends and other distributions on Shares are
        distributed, as described below, on a pro rata basis to Beneficial
        Owners of such Shares. Dividend payments are made through DTC
        Participants and Indirect Participants to Beneficial Owners then of
        record with proceeds received from the Trust.
        <br />
        <br />
        The Fund makes additional distributions to the extent necessary
        <sup>(1)</sup> to distribute the entire annual taxable income of the
        Fund, plus any net capital gains and <sup>(2)</sup> to avoid imposition
        of the excise tax imposed by Section 4982 of the Code. Management of the
        Trust reserves the right to declare special dividends if, in its
        reasonable discretion, such action is necessary or advisable to preserve
        the Fund�s eligibility for treatment as a RIC or to avoid imposition of
        income or excise taxes on undistributed income at the Fund level.
        <br />
        <br />
        Dividend Reinvestment Service. The Trust will not make the DTC
        book-entry dividend reinvestment service available for use by Beneficial
        Owners for reinvestment of their cash proceeds, but certain individual
        broker-dealers may make available the DTC book-entry Dividend
        Reinvestment Service for use by Beneficial Owners of the Fund through
        DTC Participants for reinvestment of their dividend distributions.
        Investors should contact their brokers to ascertain the availability and
        description of these services. Beneficial Owners should be aware that
        each broker may require investors to adhere to specific procedures and
        timetables to participate in the dividend reinvestment service and
        investors should ascertain from their brokers such necessary details. If
        this service is available and used, dividend distributions of both
        income and realized gains will be automatically reinvested in additional
        whole Shares issued by the Trust of the Fund at NAV per Share.
        Distributions reinvested in additional Shares will nevertheless be
        taxable to Beneficial Owners acquiring such additional Shares to the
        same extent as if such distributions had been received in cash.

        <h3>FEDERAL INCOME TAXES</h3>
        The following is only a summary of certain U.S. federal income tax
        considerations generally affecting the Fund and its shareholders that
        supplements the discussion in the Prospectus. No attempt is made to
        present a comprehensive explanation of the federal, state, local or
        foreign tax treatment of the Fund or its shareholders, and the
        discussion here and in the Prospectus is not intended to be a substitute
        for careful tax planning.
        <br />
        <br />
        The following general discussion of certain U.S. federal income tax
        consequences is based on provisions of the Code and the regulations
        issued thereunder as in effect on the date of this SAI. New legislation,
        as well as administrative changes or court decisions, may significantly
        change the conclusions expressed herein, and may have a retroactive
        effect with respect to the transactions contemplated herein.
        <br />
        <br />
        The tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act
        (the �Tax Act�) made significant changes to the U.S. federal income tax
        rules for taxation of individuals and corporations, generally effective
        for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017. Many of the changes
        applicable to individuals are temporary and would apply only to taxable
        years before January 1, 2026. There were only minor changes with respect
        to the specific rules applicable to RICs, such as the Fund. The Tax Act,
        however, also made numerous other changes to the tax rules that may
        affect shareholders and the Fund. Subsequent legislation has modified
        certain changes to the U.S. federal income tax rules made by the Tax Act
        which may, in addition, affect shareholders and the Fund. You are urged
        to consult with your own tax advisor regarding how this legislation
        affects your investment in the Fund.
        <br />
        <br />
        Shareholders are urged to consult their own tax advisers regarding the
        application of the provisions of tax law described in this SAI in light
        of the particular tax situations of the shareholders and regarding
        specific questions as to federal, state, local, or foreign taxes.
        <br />
        <br />
        Taxation of the Fund. The Fund will elect and intends to qualify each
        year to be treated as a RIC under the Code. As such, the Fund should not
        be subject to federal income taxes on its net investment income and
        capital gains, if any, to the extent that it timely distributes such
        income and capital gains to its shareholders. Generally, to be taxed as
        a RIC, the Fund must distribute in each taxable year at least 90% of its
        �investment company taxable income� (before the deduction for dividends
        paid) for the taxable year, which includes, among other items,
        dividends, interest, net short-term capital gain, and net foreign
        currency gain, less expenses, as well as 90% of its net tax-exempt
        interest income, if any (the �Distribution Requirement�) and also must
        meet several additional requirements. Among these requirements are the
        following:
        <sup>(1)</sup> at least 90% of the Fund�s gross income each taxable year
        must be derived from dividends, interest, payments with respect to
        certain securities loans, gains from the sale or other disposition of
        stock, securities, or foreign currencies, or other income derived with
        respect to its business of investing in such stock, securities, or
        foreign currencies, and net income derived from interests in qualified
        publicly traded partnerships (the �Qualifying Income Requirement�); and
        <sup>(2)</sup> at the end of each quarter of the Fund�s taxable year,
        the Fund�s assets must be diversified so that <sup>(a)</sup> at least
        50% of the value of the Fund�s total assets is represented by cash and
        cash items, U.S. government securities, securities of other RICs, and
        other securities, with such other securities limited, in respect to any
        one issuer, to an amount not greater in value than 5% of the value of
        the Fund�s total assets and to not more than 10% of the outstanding
        voting securities of such issuer, and <sup>(b)</sup> not more than 25%
        of the value of its total assets is invested in the securities (other
        than U.S. government securities or securities of other RICs) of any one
        issuer, the securities (other than securities of other RICs) of two or
        more issuers which the Fund controls and which are engaged in the same,
        similar, or related trades or businesses, or the securities of one or
        more qualified publicly traded partnerships (the �Diversification
        Requirement�).
        <br />
        <br />
        To the extent the Fund makes investments that may generate income that
        is not qualifying income, including certain derivatives, the Fund will
        seek to restrict the resulting income from such investments so that the
        Fund�s non-qualifying income does not exceed 10% of its gross income.
        <br />
        <br />
        Although the Fund intends to distribute substantially all of its net
        investment income and may distribute its capital gains for any taxable
        year, the Fund will be subject to federal income taxation to the extent
        any such income or gains are not distributed. The Fund is treated as a
        separate corporation for federal income tax purposes. The Fund therefore
        is considered to be a separate entity in determining its treatment under
        the rules for RICs described herein. The requirements (other than
        certain organizational requirements) for qualifying RIC status are
        determined at the Fund level rather than at the Trust level.
        <br />
        <br />
        If the Fund fails to satisfy the Qualifying Income Requirement or the
        Diversification Requirement in any taxable year, the Fund may be
        eligible for relief provisions if the failures are due to reasonable
        cause and not willful neglect and if a penalty tax is paid with respect
        to each failure to satisfy the applicable requirements. Additionally,
        relief is provided for certain de minimis failures of the
        Diversification Requirement where the Fund corrects the failure within a
        specified period of time. To be eligible for the relief provisions with
        respect to a failure to meet the Diversification Requirement, the Fund
        may be required to dispose of certain assets. If these relief provisions
        were not available to the Fund and it were to fail to qualify for
        treatment as a RIC for a taxable year, all of its taxable income would
        be subject to tax at regular corporate rates without any deduction for
        distributions to shareholders, and its distributions (including capital
        gains distributions) generally would be taxable to the shareholders of
        the Fund as ordinary income dividends, subject to the dividends received
        deduction for corporate shareholders and the lower tax rates on
        qualified dividend income received by noncorporate shareholders, subject
        to certain limitations. To requalify for treatment as a RIC in a
        subsequent taxable year, the Fund would be required to satisfy the RIC
        qualification requirements for that year and to distribute any earnings
        and profits from any year in which the Fund failed to qualify for tax
        treatment as a RIC. If the Fund failed to qualify as a RIC for a period
        greater than two taxable years, it would generally be required to pay a
        fund-level tax on certain net built in gains recognized with respect to
        certain of its assets upon disposition of such assets within five years
        of qualifying as a RIC in a subsequent year. The Board reserves the
        right not to maintain the qualification of the Fund for treatment as a
        RIC if it determines such course of action to be beneficial to
        shareholders. If the Fund determines that it will not qualify as a RIC,
        the Fund will establish procedures to reflect the anticipated tax
        liability in the Fund�s NAV.
        <br />
        <br />
        The Fund may elect to treat part or all of any �qualified late year
        loss� as if it had been incurred in the succeeding taxable year in
        determining the Fund�s taxable income, net capital gain, net short-term
        capital gain, and earnings and profits. The effect of this election is
        to treat any such �qualified late year loss� as if it had been incurred
        in the succeeding taxable year in characterizing Fund distributions for
        any calendar year. A �qualified late year loss� generally includes net
        capital loss, net long-term capital loss, or net short-term capital loss
        incurred after October 31 of the current taxable year, subject to
        special rules in the event the Fund makes an election under Section
        4982(e)(4) of the Code, (commonly referred to as �post-October losses�),
        and certain other late-year losses.
        <br />
        <br />
        Capital losses in excess of capital gains (�net capital losses�) are not
        permitted to be deducted against a RIC�s net investment income. Instead,
        for U.S. federal income tax purposes, potentially subject to certain
        limitations, the Fund may carry a net capital loss from any taxable year
        forward indefinitely to offset its capital gains, if any, in years
        following the year of the loss. To the extent subsequent capital gains
        are offset by such losses, they will not result in U.S. federal income
        tax liability to the Fund and may not be distributed as capital gains to
        its shareholders. Generally, the Fund may not carry forward any losses
        other than net capital losses. The carryover of capital losses may be
        limited under the general loss limitation rules if the Fund experiences
        an ownership change as defined in the Code.
        <br />
        <br />
        The Fund will be subject to a nondeductible 4% federal excise tax on
        certain undistributed income if it does not distribute to its
        shareholders in each calendar year an amount at least equal to 98% of
        its ordinary income for the calendar year plus 98.2% of its capital gain
        net income for either the one-year period ending on October 31 of that
        year, or, if the Fund makes an election under Section 4982(e)(4) of the
        Code, the Fund�s fiscal year, subject to an increase for any shortfall
        in the prior year�s distribution. The Fund intends to declare and
        distribute dividends and distributions in the amounts and at the times
        necessary to avoid the application of the excise tax, but can make no
        assurances that all such tax liability will be eliminated.
        <br />
        <br />
        The Fund intends to distribute substantially all of its net investment
        income and net capital gain to shareholders for each taxable year. If
        the Fund meets the Distribution Requirement but retains some or all of
        its income or gains, it will be subject to federal income tax at regular
        corporate rates to the extent any such income or gains are not
        distributed. The Fund may elect to designate certain amounts retained as
        undistributed net capital gain as deemed distributions in a notice to
        its shareholders, who <sup>(i)</sup> will be required to include in
        income for U.S. federal income tax purposes, as long-term capital gain,
        their proportionate shares of the undistributed amount so designated,
        <sup>(ii)</sup> will be entitled to credit their proportionate shares of
        the income tax paid by the Fund on that undistributed amount against
        their federal income tax liabilities and to claim refunds to the extent
        such credits exceed their tax liabilities, and <sup>(iii)</sup> will be
        entitled to increase their tax basis, for federal income tax purposes,
        in their Shares by an amount equal to the excess of the amount of
        undistributed net capital gain included in their respective income over
        their respective income tax credits.
        <br />
        <br />
        Taxation of Shareholders � Distributions. The Fund intends to distribute
        annually to its shareholders substantially all of its investment company
        taxable income (computed without regard to the deduction for dividends
        paid), its net tax-exempt income, if any, and any net capital gain (net
        long-term capital gains in excess of net short-term capital losses,
        taking into account any capital loss carryforwards). The distribution of
        investment company taxable income (as so computed) and net capital gain
        will be taxable to Fund shareholders regardless of whether the
        shareholder receives these distributions in cash or reinvests them in
        additional Shares.
        <br />
        <br />
        The Fund (or your broker) will report to shareholders annually the
        amounts of dividends paid from ordinary income, the amount of
        distributions of net capital gain, the portion of dividends which may
        qualify for the dividends received deduction for corporate shareholders,
        and the portion of dividends which may qualify for treatment as
        qualified dividend income, which is taxable to non-corporate
        shareholders at long-term capital gain rates.
        <br />
        <br />
        Distributions from the Fund�s net capital gain will be taxable to
        shareholders at long-term capital gains rates, regardless of how long
        shareholders have held their Shares. Distributions may be subject to
        state and local taxes.
        <br />
        <br />
        Qualified dividend income includes, in general, subject to certain
        holding period and other requirements, dividend income from taxable
        domestic corporations and certain �qualified foreign corporations.�
        Subject to certain limitations, �qualified foreign corporations� include
        those incorporated in territories of the United States, those
        incorporated in certain countries with comprehensive tax treaties with
        the United States, and other foreign corporations if the stock with
        respect to which the dividends are paid is readily tradable on an
        established securities market in the United States. Dividends received
        by the Fund from an ETF or an underlying fund taxable as a RIC or a REIT
        may be treated as qualified dividend income generally only to the extent
        so reported by such ETF, underlying fund or REIT. If 95% or more of the
        Fund�s gross income (calculated without taking into account net capital
        gain derived from sales or other dispositions of stock or securities)
        consists of qualified dividend income, the Fund may report all
        distributions of such income as qualified dividend income.
        <br />
        <br />
        Fund dividends will not be treated as qualified dividend income if the
        Fund does not meet certain holding period and other requirements with
        respect to dividend paying stocks in its portfolio, or the shareholder
        does not meet certain holding period and other requirements with respect
        to the Shares on which the dividends were paid. Distributions by the
        Fund of its net short-term capital gains will be taxable to shareholders
        as ordinary income.
        <br />
        <br />
        In the case of corporate shareholders, certain dividends received by the
        Fund from U.S. corporations (generally, dividends received by the Fund
        in respect of any share of stock <sup>(1)</sup> with a tax holding
        period of at least 46 days during the 91-day period beginning on the
        date that is 45 days before the date on which the stock becomes
        ex-dividend as to that dividend and <sup>(2)</sup> that is held in an
        unleveraged position) and distributed and appropriately so reported by
        the Fund may be eligible for the 50% dividends-received deduction.
        Certain preferred stock must have a holding period of at least 91 days
        during the 181-day period beginning on the date that is 90 days before
        the date on which the stock becomes ex-dividend as to that dividend to
        be eligible. Capital gain dividends distributed to the Fund from other
        RICs are not eligible for the dividends-received deduction. To qualify
        for the deduction, corporate shareholders must meet the minimum holding
        period requirement stated above with respect to their Shares, taking
        into account any holding period reductions from certain hedging or other
        transactions or positions that diminish their risk of loss with respect
        to their Shares, and, if they borrow to acquire or otherwise incur debt
        attributable to Shares, they may be denied a portion of the
        dividends-received deduction with respect to those Shares.
        <br />
        <br />
        Although dividends generally will be treated as distributed when paid,
        any dividend declared by the Fund in October, November or December and
        payable to shareholders of record in such a month that is paid during
        the following January will be treated for U.S. federal income tax
        purposes as received by shareholders on December 31 of the calendar year
        in which it was declared.
        <br />
        <br />
        In addition to the federal income tax, certain individuals, trusts and
        estates may be subject to a Net Investment Income (�NII�) tax of 3.8%.
        The NII tax is imposed on the lesser of: <sup>(i)</sup> a taxpayer�s
        investment income, net of deductions properly allocable to such income;
        or <sup>(ii)</sup> the amount by which such taxpayer�s modified adjusted
        gross income exceeds certain thresholds ($250,000 for married
        individuals filing jointly, $200,000 for unmarried individuals and
        $125,000 for married individuals filing separately). The Fund�s
        distributions are includable in a shareholder�s investment income for
        purposes of this NII tax. In addition, any capital gain realized by a
        shareholder upon a sale or redemption of Fund shares is includable in
        such shareholder�s investment income for purposes of this NII tax.
        <br />
        <br />
        Shareholders who have not held Shares for a full year should be aware
        that the Fund may report and distribute, as ordinary dividends or
        capital gain dividends, a percentage of income that is not equal to the
        percentage of the Fund�s ordinary income or net capital gain,
        respectively, actually earned during the applicable shareholder�s period
        of investment in the Fund. A taxable shareholder may wish to avoid
        investing in the Fund shortly before a dividend or other distribution,
        because the distribution will generally be taxable to the shareholder
        even though it may economically represent a return of a portion of the
        shareholder�s investment.
        <br />
        <br />
        To the extent that the Fund makes a distribution of income received by
        the Fund in lieu of dividends (a �substitute payment�) with respect to
        securities on loan pursuant to a securities lending transaction, such
        income will not constitute qualified dividend income to individual
        shareholders and will not be eligible for the dividends received
        deduction for corporate shareholders.
        <br />
        <br />
        If the Fund�s distributions exceed its earnings and profits, all or a
        portion of the distributions made for a taxable year may be
        recharacterized as a return of capital to shareholders. A return of
        capital distribution will generally not be taxable, but will reduce each
        shareholder�s cost basis in the Fund and result in a higher capital gain
        or lower capital loss when the Shares on which the distribution was
        received are sold. After a shareholder�s basis in the Shares has been
        reduced to zero, distributions in excess of earnings and profits will be
        treated as gain from the sale of the shareholder�s Shares.
        <br />
        <br />
        Taxation of Shareholders � Sale of Shares. A sale or redemption of
        Shares may give rise to a gain or loss. In general, any gain or loss
        realized upon a taxable disposition of Shares will be treated as
        long-term capital gain or loss if Shares have been held for more than 12
        months. Otherwise, the gain or loss on the taxable disposition of Shares
        will generally be treated as short-term capital gain or loss. Any loss
        realized upon a taxable disposition of Shares held for six months or
        less will be treated as long-term capital loss, rather than short-term
        capital loss, to the extent of any amounts treated as distributions to
        the shareholder of long-term capital gain with respect to such Shares
        (including any amounts credited to the shareholder as undistributed
        capital gains). All or a portion of any loss realized upon a taxable
        disposition of Shares may be disallowed if substantially identical
        Shares are acquired (through the reinvestment of dividends or otherwise)
        within a 61-day period beginning 30 days before and ending 30 days after
        the disposition. In such a case, the basis of the newly acquired Shares
        will be adjusted to reflect the disallowed loss.
        <br />
        <br />
        The cost basis of Shares acquired by purchase will generally be based on
        the amount paid for Shares and then may be subsequently adjusted for
        other applicable transactions as required by the Code. The difference
        between the selling price and the cost basis of Shares generally
        determines the amount of the capital gain or loss realized on the sale
        of Shares. Contact the broker through whom you purchased your Shares to
        obtain information with respect to the available cost basis reporting
        methods and elections for your account.
        <br />
        <br />
        An Authorized Participant who exchanges securities for Creation Units
        generally will recognize a gain or a loss. The gain or loss will be
        equal to the difference between the market value of the Creation Units
        at the time and the sum of the exchanger�s aggregate basis in the
        securities surrendered plus the amount of cash paid for such Creation
        Units. A person who redeems Creation Units will generally recognize a
        gain or loss equal to the difference between the exchanger�s basis in
        the Creation Units and the sum of the aggregate market value of any
        securities received plus the amount of any cash received for such
        Creation Units. The Internal Revenue Service (�IRS�), however, may
        assert that a loss realized upon an exchange of securities for Creation
        Units cannot currently be deducted under the rules governing �wash
        sales� (for an exchanger who does not mark-to-market its portfolio) or
        on the basis that there has been no significant change in economic
        position.
        <br />
        <br />
        Any capital gain or loss realized upon the creation of Creation Units
        will generally be treated as long-term capital gain or loss if the
        securities exchanged for such Creation Units have been held for more
        than one year. Any capital gain or loss realized upon the redemption of
        Creation Units will generally be treated as long-term capital gain or
        loss if the Shares composing the Creation Units have been held for more
        than one year. Otherwise, such capital gains or losses will generally be
        treated as short-term capital gains or losses. Any loss upon a
        redemption of Creation Units held for six months or less may be treated
        as long-term capital loss to the extent of any amounts treated as
        distributions to the applicable Authorized Participant of long-term
        capital gain with respect to the Creation Units (including any amounts
        credited to the Authorized Participant as undistributed capital gains).
        <br />
        <br />
        The Trust, on behalf of the Fund, has the right to reject an order for
        Creation Units if the purchaser (or a group of purchasers) would, upon
        obtaining the Creation Units so ordered, own 80% or more of the
        outstanding Shares and if, pursuant to Section 351 of the Code, the Fund
        would have a basis in the deposit securities different from the market
        value of such securities on the date of deposit. The Trust also has the
        right to require the provision of information necessary to determine
        beneficial Share ownership for purposes of the 80% determination. If the
        Fund does issue Creation Units to a purchaser (or a group of purchasers)
        that would, upon obtaining the Creation Units so ordered, own 80% or
        more of the outstanding Shares, the purchaser (or a group of purchasers)
        will not recognize gain or loss upon the exchange of securities for
        Creation Units.
        <br />
        <br />
        Persons purchasing or redeeming Creation Units should consult their own
        tax advisers with respect to the tax treatment of any creation or
        redemption transaction and whether the wash sales rule applies and when
        a loss may be deductible.
        <br />
        <br />
        Taxation of Fund Investments. Certain of the Fund�s investments may be
        subject to complex provisions of the Code (including provisions relating
        to hedging transactions, straddles, integrated transactions, foreign
        currency contracts, forward foreign currency contracts, and notional
        principal contracts) that, among other things, may affect the Fund�s
        ability to qualify as a RIC, affect the character of gains and losses
        realized by the Fund (e.g., may affect whether gains or losses are
        ordinary or capital), accelerate recognition of income to the Fund and
        defer losses. These rules could therefore affect the character, amount
        and timing of distributions to shareholders. These provisions also may
        require the Fund to mark to market certain types of positions in its
        portfolio (i.e., treat them as if they were closed out) which may cause
        the Fund to recognize income without the Fund receiving cash with which
        to make distributions in amounts sufficient to enable the Fund to
        satisfy the RIC distribution requirements for avoiding Fund-level income
        and excise taxes. The Fund intends to monitor its transactions, intends
        to make appropriate tax elections, and intends to make appropriate
        entries in its books and records to mitigate the effect of these rules
        and preserve the Fund�s qualification for treatment as a RIC. To the
        extent the Fund invests in an underlying fund that is taxable as a RIC,
        the rules applicable to the tax treatment of complex securities will
        also apply to the underlying funds that also invest in such complex
        securities and investments. In addition, because the tax rules
        applicable to such instruments may be uncertain under current law, an
        adverse determination or future IRS guidance with respect to these rules
        (which determination or guidance could be retroactive) may affect
        whether the Fund has made sufficient distributions and otherwise
        satisfied the relevant requirements to maintain its qualification as a
        RIC and avoid a Fund-level tax.
        <br />
        <br />
        Backup Withholding. The Fund will be required in certain cases to
        withhold (as �backup withholding�) on amounts payable to any shareholder
        who
        <sup>(1)</sup> fails to provide a correct taxpayer identification number
        certified under penalty of perjury; <sup>(2)</sup> is subject to backup
        withholding by the IRS for failure to properly report all payments of
        interest or dividends; <sup>(3)</sup> fails to provide a certified
        statement that they are not subject to �backup withholding;� or
        <sup>(4)</sup> fails to provide a certified statement that they are a
        U.S. person (including a U.S. resident alien). The backup withholding
        rate is at a rate set under Section 3406 of the Code. Backup withholding
        is not an additional tax and any amounts withheld may be credited
        against the shareholder�s ultimate U.S. federal income tax liability.
        Backup withholding will not be applied to payments that have been
        subject to the 30% withholding tax on shareholders who are neither
        citizens nor permanent residents of the United States.
        <br />
        <br />
        Non-U.S. Shareholders. Any non-U.S. investors in the Fund may be subject
        to U.S. withholding and estate tax and are encouraged to consult their
        tax advisors prior to investing in the Fund. Foreign shareholders (i.e.,
        nonresident alien individuals and foreign corporations, partnerships,
        trusts and estates) are generally subject to a U.S. withholding tax at
        the rate of 30% (or a lower tax treaty rate) on distributions derived
        from taxable ordinary income. The Fund may, under certain circumstances,
        report all or a portion of a dividend as an �interest-related dividend�
        or a �short-term capital gain dividend,� which would generally be exempt
        from this 30% U.S. withholding tax, provided certain other requirements
        are met. Short-term capital gain dividends received by a nonresident
        alien individual who is present in the U.S. for a period or periods
        aggregating 183 days or more during the taxable year are not exempt from
        this 30% withholding tax. Gains realized by foreign shareholders from
        the sale or other disposition of Shares generally are not subject to
        U.S. taxation, unless the recipient is an individual who is physically
        present in the U.S. for 183 days or more per year (based on a formula
        that factors in presence in the U.S. during the two preceding years as
        well). Foreign shareholders who fail to provide an applicable IRS form
        may be subject to backup withholding on certain payments from the Fund.
        Backup withholding will not be applied to payments that are subject to
        the 30% (or lower applicable treaty rate) withholding tax described in
        this paragraph. Different tax consequences may result if the foreign
        shareholder is engaged in a trade or business within the United States.
        In addition, the tax consequences to a foreign shareholder entitled to
        claim the benefits of a tax treaty may be different than those described
        above.
        <br />
        <br />
        Under the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (�FATCA�), the Fund may be
        required to withhold a generally nonrefundable 30% tax on distributions
        of net investment income paid to <sup>(a)</sup> certain �foreign
        financial institutions� unless such foreign financial institution agrees
        to verify, monitor, and report to the IRS the identity of certain of its
        account holders, among other items (or unless such entity is otherwise
        deemed compliant under the terms of an intergovernmental agreement
        between the United States and the foreign financial institution�s
        country of residence), and <sup>(b)</sup> certain �non-financial foreign
        entities� unless such entity certifies to the Fund that it does not have
        any substantial U.S. owners or provides the name, address, and taxpayer
        identification number of each substantial U.S. owner, among other items.
        This FATCA withholding tax could also affect the Fund�s return on its
        investments in foreign securities or affect a shareholder�s return if
        the shareholder holds its Fund shares through a foreign intermediary.
        You are urged to consult your tax adviser regarding the application of
        this FATCA withholding tax to your investment in the Fund and the
        potential certification, compliance, due diligence, reporting, and
        withholding obligations to which you may become subject in order to
        avoid this withholding tax.
        <br />
        <br />
        For foreign shareholders to qualify for an exemption from backup
        withholding, described above, the foreign shareholder must comply with
        special certification and filing requirements. Foreign shareholders in
        the Fund should consult their tax advisors in this regard.
        <br />
        <br />
        Tax-Exempt Shareholders. Certain tax-exempt shareholders, including
        qualified pension plans, individual retirement accounts, salary deferral
        arrangements, 401(k) plans, and other tax-exempt entities, generally are
        exempt from federal income taxation, except with respect to their
        unrelated business taxable income (�UBTI�). Tax-exempt entities are
        generally not permitted to offset losses from one unrelated trade or
        business against the income or gain of another unrelated trade or
        business. Certain net losses incurred prior to January 1, 2018 are
        permitted to offset gain and income created by an unrelated trade or
        business, if otherwise available. Under current law, the Fund generally
        serves to block UBTI from being realized by its tax-exempt shareholders
        with respect to their shares of Fund income. However, notwithstanding
        the foregoing, tax-exempt shareholders could realize UBTI by virtue of
        their investment in the Fund if, for example, <sup>(1)</sup> the Fund
        invests in residual interests of Real Estate Mortgage Investment
        Conduits (�REMICs�), <sup>(2)</sup> the Fund invests in a REIT that is a
        taxable mortgage pool (�TMP�) or that has a subsidiary that is a TMP or
        that invests in the residual interest of a REMIC, or
        <sup>(3)</sup> Shares in the Fund constitute debt-financed property in
        the hands of the tax-exempt shareholders within the meaning of section
        514(b) of the Code. Charitable remainder trusts are subject to special
        rules and should consult their tax advisers. The IRS has issued guidance
        with respect to these issues and prospective shareholders, especially
        charitable remainder trusts, are strongly encouraged to consult with
        their tax advisers regarding these issues.
        <br />
        <br />
        Certain Potential Tax Reporting Requirements. Under U.S. Treasury
        regulations, if a shareholder recognizes a loss on disposition of the
        Shares of $2 million or more for an individual shareholder or $10
        million or more for a corporate shareholder (or certain greater amounts
        over a combination of years), the shareholder must file with the IRS a
        disclosure statement on IRS Form 8886. Direct shareholders of portfolio
        securities are in many cases excepted from this reporting requirement,
        but under current guidance, shareholders of a RIC are not excepted.
        Significant penalties may be imposed for the failure to comply with the
        reporting requirements. The fact that a loss is reportable under these
        regulations does not affect the legal determination of whether the
        taxpayer�s treatment of the loss is proper. Shareholders should consult
        their tax advisors to determine the applicability of these regulations
        in light of their individual circumstances.
        <br />
        <br />
        Other Issues. In those states which have income tax laws, the tax
        treatment of the Fund and of Fund shareholders with respect to
        distributions by the Fund may differ from federal tax treatment.

        <h3>Item 30. Indemnification</h3>
        Reference is made to Article VII of the Registrant�s Declaration of
        Trust. The general effect of this provision is to indemnify the
        Trustees, officers, employees and other agents of the Trust who are
        parties pursuant to any proceeding by reason of their actions performed
        in their scope of service on behalf of the Trust.
        <br />
        Pursuant to Rule 484 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the
        �Securities Act�), the Registrant furnishes the following undertaking:
        �Insofar as indemnification for liability arising under the Securities
        Act of 1933 may be permitted to trustees, officers and controlling
        persons of the Registrant pursuant to the foregoing provisions, or
        otherwise, the Registrant has been advised that, in the opinion of the
        Securities and Exchange Commission such indemnification is against
        public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and is, therefore,
        unenforceable. In the event that a claim for indemnification against
        such liabilities (other than the payment by the Registrant of expenses
        incurred or paid by a trustee, officer or controlling person of the
        Registrant in the successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding)
        is asserted by such trustee, officer or controlling person in connection
        with the securities being registered, the Registrant will, unless in the
        opinion of its counsel the matter has been settled by controlling
        precedent, submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question
        whether such indemnification by it is against public policy as expressed
        in the Securities Act and will be governed by the final adjudication of
        such issue.�
