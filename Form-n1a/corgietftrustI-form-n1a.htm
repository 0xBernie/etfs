        unchanged operating expenses. Brokerage commissions you may pay when

      The Fund also incurs transaction and financing costs associated with
      derivatives and with the purchase and sale of portfolio instruments. These
      costs are not reflected in the table or the Example above.

      <br />
      <div align="LEFT">
        <b>Portfolio Turnover</b>
        <br />
        When the Fund buys and sells securities and derivatives, it incurs
        trading costs such as brokerage commissions. Greater trading activity
        (often called portfolio turnover) generally means higher trading
        expenses and, in taxable accounts, may result in larger taxable
        distributions. These amounts are not included in Total Annual Fund
        Operating Expenses or in the Expense Example and will reduce the Fund's
        returns. Because the Fund is newly formed, a portfolio turnover rate is
        not yet available.

      </div>

      <br />

      <div align="LEFT">
        <b>Principal Investment Strategies</b>
        <br />
        The Fund is an exchange-traded fund ("ETF") that uses a "passive
        management" (or indexing) approach to track the performance, before fees
        and expenses, of the Founder-Led Index (the "Index"). The Index tracks
        the performance of the top 50 founder-led publicly traded U.S.
        companies, defined as companies where at least one original founder
        currently serves in a C-suite or equivalent key executive role (e.g.,
        CEO, Executive Chair, President, CTO, CFO). The Index is owned and
        maintained by Corgi Strategies, LLC (the "Index Owner"), which is
        responsible for the selection criteria, constituent determination, and
        weighting methodology. Solactive AG (the "Index Calculator") calculates
        and disseminates the Index on behalf of Corgi Strategies, LLC.
      </div>

      <br />

      <div align="LEFT">
        <h3>The Index</h3>
        <b>I. Eligible Universe</b>
        <br />
        The Index's eligible universe includes common equity securities of
        U.S.-listed companies with primary listings only (excluding American
        Depositary Receipts and over-the-counter securities).
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>II. Constituent Selection</b>
        <br />
        From the eligible universe, companies are screened to identify
        founder-led issuers, meaning companies where at least one original
        founder currently serves in a C-suite or equivalent key executive role
        (e.g., CEO, Executive Chair, President, CTO, CFO). Among these
        founder-led issuers, the Index selects 50 companies using free float
        adjusted market capitalization and liquidity criteria.
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>III. Weighting</b>
        <br />
        Constituents are weighted by free float adjusted market value, subject
        to a maximum of 10% per issuer as of each Rebalance Day. If the Index
        becomes concentrated in a particular sector or industry, the Fund is
        expected to mirror that concentration.
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>IV. Rebalancing</b>
        <br />
        The Index is reconstituted and rebalanced quarterly after the close on
        the third Friday of March, June, September, and December, with changes
        effective on the next trading day (each, a "Rebalance Day"). The 10%
        single issuer cap is applied at each Rebalance Day.
        <br />
        <br />
        Between scheduled rebalances, if any constituent's closing weight rises
        above 20%, that name is reset to 10% and the excess weight is spread
        across the remaining constituents on a pro rata basis. This drift
        control can result in interim adjustments outside of the regular
        quarterly schedule. These interim adjustments may trigger additional
        transaction costs in the Fund during replication/sampling (see "Index
        Rebalancing Risk").
        <br />
      </div>

      <br />

      <div align="LEFT">
        <h3>The Fund's Investment Strategy</h3>
        The Fund seeks to achieve its investment objective by obtaining exposure
        to the Index primarily through (i) direct holdings of some or all of the
        equity securities included in the Index and/or (ii) the use of financial
        instruments (such as swap contracts) that provide economic exposure to
        one or more Index constituents. The Fund may also hold cash and
        short-term U.S. government securities (and/or other cash equivalents)
        for liquidity, collateral, and portfolio management purposes.
        <br />
        <br />
        Under normal market conditions, the Fund will invest at least 80% of its
        net assets, plus any borrowings for investment purposes, in founder-led
        company equities included in the Index and/or in financial instruments
        that collectively provide exposure to founder-led companies represented
        in the Index.
        <br />
        <br />
        The Fund may use a replication approach or, when full replication is not
        practical, a representative sampling approach. In either case, the Fund
        seeks aggregate characteristics (including risk and return) that are
        consistent with its objective.
        <br />
        <br />
        If the Index concentrates in a particular industry or group of
        industries, the Fund will concentrate its investments to approximately
        the same extent. The Fund is classified as non-diversified under the
        Investment Company Act of 1940.
        <br />
      </div>

      <br />

      <div align="LEFT">
        <b>Principal Risks of Investing in the Fund</b>
        <br /><br />
        The principal risks are presented in alphabetical order to make
        comparison easier across funds. Each risk described below is considered
        a "principal risk" of investing in the Fund, regardless of its order. As
        with any investment, you could lose all or part of your investment. Any
        of these risks could adversely affect the Fund's net asset value
        ("NAV"), market price, yield, total return, and/or its ability to
        achieve its objective.
        <br /><br />
        <b>AP and Market Maker Dependence Risk.</b>
        The Fund relies on a limited number of authorized participants ("APs")
        and market makers to create, redeem, and provide liquidity in Shares. If
        these firms curtail or cease their activities and others do not step in,
        Shares may trade at significant premiums/discounts to NAV, experience
        wider bid-ask spreads, or be subject to trading halts or delisting.
        <br /><br />
        <b>Brokerage Commissions and Bid-Ask Spread Risk.</b>
        Investors transacting in the secondary market will pay brokerage
        commissions and may bear costs associated with the bid-ask spread. These
        costs tend to rise when trading volume is low or markets are stressed
        and can materially reduce investment results, especially for frequent or
        small transactions.
        <br /><br />
        <b>Concentration in Founder-Led Companies Risk.</b>
        Because the Index focuses on companies led by one or more original
        founders, the Fund's holdings may reflect governance practices,
        strategic choices, and corporate cultures that differ from peers. This
        thematic focus narrows the investable universe and may cause performance
        to differ—positively or negatively—from broader equity markets.
        <br /><br />
        <b>Control and Dual-Class Share Structures Risk.</b>
        Some founder-led issuers employ control mechanisms (e.g., dual-class
        voting) that concentrate voting power. Such structures can entrench
        management, reduce responsiveness to public shareholders, or amplify the
        market impact of founder-specific decisions or controversies.
        <br /><br />
        <b>Index Calculation & Methodology Risk.</b>
        Mistakes in index data, calculations, or application of the methodology
        can occur and may not be promptly remedied, which can affect the Fund.
        Errors, delays, or methodology misapplications—such as in classifying
        founder-led status, share counts, corporate actions, or float
        adjustments—may cause unintended inclusions/exclusions or inaccurate
        weights until corrected. Under the Index Calculation Agreement,
        Solactive does not serve as the index "administrator" and is engaged
        solely to calculate, maintain, and disseminate Index Levels in line with
        the methodology provided by the Index Owner; in cases not covered or not
        clearly regulated by the methodology, the Index Owner and Solactive
        consult to agree on treatment, and Solactive may, if guidance is not
        timely available, implement adjustments in its commercially reasonable
        judgment.
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>Index Ownership and Conflicts of Interest Risk.</b>
        The Adviser (or an affiliate) owns the Index intellectual property and
        licenses it to the Fund. Although the Adviser does not receive
        index-licensing revenue from the Fund, conflicts could arise in index
        rule design, constituent determinations, or timing of rebalances. The
        Trust maintains information-barrier policies and Board oversight;
        however, such measures may not fully eliminate perceived or actual
        conflicts.
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>Large-Capitalization Companies Risk.</b>
        Large-cap issuers can be slower to adapt to competitive or technological
        shifts and, in some environments, may underperform smaller companies
        that are more nimble.
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>New Fund Risk.</b>
        The Fund is newly organized and has limited or no operating history. It
        may take time to attract assets, build secondary-market liquidity, and
        achieve efficient index tracking.
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>Non-Diversified Fund Risk.</b>
        As a non-diversified fund under the Investment Company Act of 1940, the
        Fund may invest a larger portion of assets in fewer issuers than a
        diversified fund. Losses in a single issuer could have a proportionately
        greater adverse effect on the Fund's performance.
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>Operational and Cybersecurity Risk.</b>
        The Fund and its service providers rely on complex processes and
        technology. Human error, processing or communication failures, cyber
        incidents, or disruptions at counterparties and other third parties
        could impair operations, result in financial loss, or hinder the Fund's
        ability to meet its objective.
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>Passive Strategy Risk.</b>
        The Fund seeks to track the Index and does not take temporary defensive
        positions. Performance may deviate from broad market returns or active
        strategies; the Fund will not attempt to mitigate declines in the Index.
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>Premium/Discount to NAV Risk.</b>
        Shares trade at market prices that may be above (premium) or below
        (discount) NAV, particularly when market volatility is elevated, trading
        volume is limited, or the Index/portfolio experiences disruptions.
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>Rebalance and Intra-Quarter Drift Adjustment Risk.</b>
        The Index applies a 10% single-stock cap at each scheduled quarterly
        rebalance and may implement out-of-cycle adjustments if a constituent's
        weight exceeds a 20% drift threshold (resetting to 10% and
        redistributing the excess pro rata). These actions can increase
        turnover, transaction costs, and taxable gains, and may contribute to
        tracking difference.
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>Sector/Industry Focus Risk.</b>
        Founder-led issuers may cluster in particular sectors or industries. If
        the Index becomes concentrated in any sector(s), the Fund will reflect
        that concentration and may be more sensitive to sector-specific
        developments than a more diversified approach.
        <br /><br />
        <b>Succession and Key-Person Exposure Risk.</b>
        The departure, reduced role, or loss of influence of a company's founder
        or other key executive may adversely affect the issuer's prospects and,
        in some cases, its continued eligibility for the Index, potentially
        leading to removals at reconstitution and additional turnover.
        <br /><br />
        <b>Swap Agreements and Other Derivatives Risk.</b>
        To the extent the Fund uses derivatives (e.g., total return swaps) to
        obtain exposure or for portfolio management, it is subject to
        counterparty, liquidity, valuation, leverage, and correlation risks.
        Derivatives can be more volatile than direct holdings and may increase
        exposure to certain market risks.
        <br /><br />
        <b>Tracking Difference and Tracking Error Risk.</b>
        The Fund's results may differ from those of the Index for various
        reasons. The Fund bears operating expenses and portfolio transaction
        costs that the Index does not. The Fund may not be fully invested in
        Index constituents at all times, may hold securities not included in the
        Index, and may experience timing differences, cash holdings, corporate
        actions, tax considerations, or fair-value pricing that contribute to
        tracking difference.

        <b>Performance</b>
        <br />
        <br />
        Because the Fund has not completed a full calendar year of operations as
        of the date of this Prospectus, performance information is not
        presented. After the Fund has a full calendar year of results, this
        section will include a calendar-year bar chart and a table of average
        annual total returns, which will help illustrate the variability of
        returns over time and will compare the Fund's results with those of the
        Index and a broad-based securities market index. Past performance
        (before and after taxes) is not a guarantee of future results. Once
        available, updated performance information will be posted on the Fund's
        website at www.founderledfunds.com.

        <b>Management</b>
        <br />
        <br />
        Investment Adviser: Corgi Strategies, LLC serves as investment adviser
        to the Fund.
        <br />
        <br />
        Portfolio Managers: The individual primarily responsible for the
        day-to-day management of the Fund is Brianna A. Lynch, Portfolio Manager
        for the Adviser; who has been a portfolio manager of the Fund since its
        inception in 2025.

      <div align="LEFT">
        <b>Purchase and Sale of Shares</b>
        <br />
        <br />
        The Fund issues and redeems shares only in large blocks called "Creation
        Units" at NAV next determined after an order is accepted. Only
        authorized participants ("APs") may transact in Creation Units directly
        with the Fund. Creation Units are generally issued and redeemed in
        exchange for a basket of securities and/or cash; the Fund may, in its
        discretion, permit or require all-cash creations or redemptions.
        <br />
        <br />
        Individual Shares are listed for trading on [ ] (the "Exchange") and may
        be bought or sold in the secondary market at market prices rather than
        at NAV. Market prices may be above (premium to) or below (discount to)
        NAV. Investors trading on an exchange will pay brokerage commissions and
        may be affected by the bid-ask spread.
        <br />
        <br />
        As available, information required by Rule 6c-11 (including the Fund's
        NAV, market price, historical premiums/discounts, and median bid-ask
        spread) will be posted on the Fund's website at www.founderledfunds.com.
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>Tax Information</b>
        <br />
        <br />
        Fund distributions are generally taxable to shareholders as ordinary
        income, qualified dividend income, and/or capital gains (or some
        combination), unless shares are held through an individual retirement
        account ("IRA") or other tax-advantaged arrangement, in which case taxes
        may be due upon withdrawal. Your tax treatment may vary; consult your
        tax adviser about your particular circumstances.
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>Financial Intermediary Compensation</b>
        <br />
        <br />
        If you purchase Shares through a financial intermediary (e.g., a
        broker-dealer or bank), the Adviser or its affiliates may, from their
        own resources, compensate the intermediary for activities related to the
        distribution, marketing, promotion, or sale of Shares, or for
        shareholder and educational support. These payments may create a
        conflict of interest by incentivizing the intermediary or its personnel
        to recommend the Fund over other investments. Such payments are not made
        by the Fund and do not increase the expenses paid by the Fund. Ask your
        salesperson or visit your intermediary's website for more information.

        <h3>ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT THE FUND</h3>
        <b>Investment Objective</b>
        <br />
        <br />
        The Founder-Led ETF (the "Fund") seeks to track the performance, before
        fees and expenses, of the Founder-Led Index (the "Index").
        <br />
        <br />
        An investment objective is fundamental if it cannot be changed without
        the approval of a "majority of the outstanding voting securities" (as
        defined in the Investment Company Act of 1940). The Fund's investment
        objective is not fundamental and may be changed by the Board of Trustees
        (the "Board") of Corgi ETF Trust I (the "Trust") upon 60 days' prior
        written notice to shareholders.
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>Principal Investment Strategies</b>
        <br />
        <br />
        The Fund's policy to invest, under normal market conditions, at least
        80% of its net assets (plus any borrowings for investment purposes) in
        equity securities of founder-led companies and/or in financial
        instruments that provide economic exposure to founder-led companies is
        non-fundamental and may be changed by the Board upon 60 days' prior
        written notice to shareholders. For purposes of the Fund's 80% policy,
        the Fund will measure assets including the notional value of derivatives
        (adjusted as required) consistent with Rule 35d-1.
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>The Index</b>
        <br />
        <br />
        The Index is owned by Corgi Strategies, LLC and licensed for use by the
        Fund. The Adviser does not receive index-licensing revenue from the
        Fund. Because the Adviser (or an affiliate) owns the Index IP, this
        "self-indexing" arrangement presents potential conflicts of interest;
        the Trust maintains information-barrier policies and procedures, and the
        Board provides oversight of index-related processes.
        <br /><br />
        Solactive AG ("Index Calculator") acts as the calculation agent and
        index-maintenance and dissemination service provider (via a
        dissemination agent) for the Index. Solactive does not act as the Index
        "administrator".
        <br /><br />
        In summary, the Index screens U.S.-listed companies to identify
        founder-led issuers and selects the top 50 qualifying names by
        free-float market capitalization, subject to liquidity criteria.
        Constituents are weighted by free-float market capitalization, applying
        a 10% single-issuer cap on each Rebalance Day. Between Rebalance Days,
        if any constituent's closing weight exceeds 20%, it is reset to 10% and
        the excess weight is redistributed pro rata across the remaining
        constituents, subject to the methodology's constraints.
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>Rebalancing Schedule</b>
        <br />
        <br />
        The Index is reconstituted and rebalanced quarterly after the close on
        the third Friday of March, June, September, and December, with changes
        effective on the next trading day (each, a "Rebalance Day").
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>Manager of Managers Structure</b>
        <br />
        <br />
        The Fund does not currently employ a sub-adviser. The Adviser intends to
        seek exemptive relief from the SEC permitting the Adviser, subject to
        Board approval and applicable conditions, to appoint, replace, or
        materially amend agreements with unaffiliated sub-advisers without
        shareholder approval. Shareholders will be notified of any such changes
        as required. Any sub-advisory compensation will be paid by the Adviser
        and not by the Fund. The Adviser retains overall responsibility, under
        Board oversight, for supervising any sub-adviser(s), including
        selection, evaluation, and termination.

      <div align="LEFT">
        <b>Principal Risks of Investing in the Fund</b>
        <br />
        <br />
        The principal risks are presented in alphabetical order to make it
        easier to locate specific risks and to compare them with those of other
        funds. Each risk summarized below is regarded as a "principal risk" of
        investing in the Fund, regardless of the order in which it appears.
        Investing involves risk, including the possible loss of principal. Any
        of the risks described can adversely affect the Fund's NAV, market
        price, income, or total return. Some or all of these risks may adversely
        affect the Fund's NAV per share price, yield, total return, and/or the
        Fund's ability to achieve its objective. The risks below could
        negatively affect the value of your investment in the Fund.
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>Equity Market Risk.</b> Common stocks generally carry more risk than
        preferred stock or debt because common shareholders are lower in the
        capital structure. Equity holdings may experience significant price
        volatility such as sharp, unexpected declines or extended downturns due
        to broad market conditions or developments specific to an issuer,
        industry, or sector held by the Fund.
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>ETF Risks.</b>
        <br />
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b
              >Authorized Participants, Market Makers, and Liquidity Providers
              Concentration Risk.</b
            >
            The Fund relies on a limited number of financial institutions that
            are authorized to purchase and redeem Creation Units directly with
            the Fund (each, an Authorized Participant or AP). There may also be
            a limited number of market makers and other liquidity providers
            active in Shares. If (i) APs exit the business, become unable to
            process creation and/or redemption orders, and no other APs step in,
            or (ii) market makers and/or other liquidity providers leave the
            market or materially scale back their activity and no replacements
            emerge, Shares may trade at a material discount to NAV and, in
            extreme cases, could face delisting.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <b>Costs of Buying or Selling Shares.</b> Investors who trade Shares
            in the secondary market will pay brokerage commissions or other
            charges set by their broker. Commissions are often fixed amounts and
            can be a significant proportional cost for investors transacting in
            small sizes. Secondary-market investors also bear the bid-ask
            spread. The spread varies over time with trading volume and market
            liquidity—generally narrower when trading volume and liquidity are
            higher and wider when they are lower. A relatively small investor
            base, sizable asset flows into or out of the Fund, and/or periods of
            elevated market volatility may widen spreads. Because commissions
            and spreads add to trading costs, frequent trading of Shares can
            materially reduce returns and may be inadvisable for investors who
            expect to make regular, small purchases or sales.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <b>Shares May Trade at Prices Other Than NAV.</b> As with all ETFs,
            Shares trade on an exchange at market prices that may differ from
            the Fund's NAV. At times, Shares may trade at an intraday premium
            (above NAV) or discount (below NAV) due to supply and demand for
            Shares or during volatile markets. This risk can be heightened in
            periods of market stress, sharp market declines, or when
            secondary-market trading activity in Shares is limited, in which
            case premiums or discounts may be significant.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <b>Trading.</b> Although Shares are listed for trading on [ ] (the
            "Exchange") and may trade on other U.S. exchanges, there is no
            assurance that Shares will trade with active volume, or trade at
            all, on any exchange. In stressed market conditions, the liquidity
            of Shares and the liquidity of the Fund's portfolio holdings may
            deteriorate.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <b>General Market Risk.</b> Global economies and financial markets are
        increasingly interconnected, which raises the likelihood that events or
        conditions in one country or region will adversely affect markets or
        issuers elsewhere. Securities held by the Fund may underperform the
        broader markets, a particular market segment, or other asset classes due
        to factors that can include inflation (or expectations of inflation),
        interest-rate changes, shifts in global demand for products or
        resources, natural disasters or other major events, public-health
        emergencies, terrorism, regulatory developments, and governmental
        controls.
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>Market Capitalization Risk.</b> Securities of large-capitalization
        companies may be relatively mature compared to smaller firms and
        therefore may exhibit slower growth during economic expansions.
        Large-capitalization companies may also be less agile in responding to
        new competitive challenges, including technological change and evolving
        consumer preferences.
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>Market Events Risk.</b> Financial markets can be volatile, and
        security prices can move substantially based on business cycles,
        interest-rate shifts, inflation or deflation views, perceived credit
        risk, and prevailing market liquidity, among other influences. In
        addition, the value of the Fund's investments may be negatively affected
        by the occurrence of global events. Global shocks, such as wars,
        terrorism, environmental or natural disasters, political instability,
        and epidemics or pandemics, as well as sanctions and trade restrictions
        (including those tied to recent conflicts in Eastern Europe and the
        Middle East) have increased market volatility and could continue to do
        so, affecting regional and global economies and certain securities.
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>New Fund Risk.</b> The Fund is newly organized and has limited or no
        operating history. As a result, prospective investors do not have a
        performance record on which to base their investment decisions. The Fund
        may require time to attract assets, develop secondary-market liquidity,
        and achieve efficient index tracking.
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>Non-Diversification Risk.</b> Because the Fund is "non-diversified,"
        it may invest a greater percentage of its assets in the securities of a
        single issuer or a smaller number of issuers than if it were
        diversified. Consequently, weakness in one issuer or in a small group of
        issuers can have a proportionately larger impact on the Fund's value.
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>Operational Risk.</b> The Fund is exposed to operational risks
        arising from people, processes, systems, and third parties. These risks
        include human mistakes; trade, settlement, or communication errors;
        failures or delays by service providers, counterparties, or other
        vendors; and breakdowns or outages in processes, technology, or other
        infrastructure. The Fund relies on external firms (e.g., custodian,
        transfer agent, administrator, pricing and data providers) for key
        functions, and difficulties engaging or retaining such providers, or
        disruptions in their services, could impair the Fund's operations and
        hinder achievement of its investment objective. The Fund and the Adviser
        maintain controls and procedures intended to manage operational risk,
        but no control environment can eliminate it entirely.
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>Passive Investment Risk.</b> The Fund is not actively managed and
        does not attempt to outperform its Index or take defensive positions in
        declining markets. As a result, the Fund's performance may be adversely
        affected by a general decline in the market segments relating to its
        Index. Because the Fund seeks to track its Index, its returns may lag
        other strategies or asset classes. Different categories of securities
        lead or lag at different times, sometimes for multi-year stretches, and
        the Fund will not take defensive positions to avoid such cycles.
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>Sector and Industry Risk.</b> If the Fund invests more heavily in
        particular sectors or industries, its results will be especially
        sensitive to events that significantly affect those areas. To the extent
        the Index becomes concentrated in one or more sectors or industries, the
        Fund will have similar exposure and could be negatively affected by
        adverse developments impacting those sectors or industries.
        <br />
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>Information Technology Sector Risk.</b> Companies in the
            information technology sector, and firms that rely heavily on
            technology, face fast product cycles, the risk of rapid
            obsolescence, evolving standards, and heightened regulation.
            Competition can be intense both domestically and internationally,
            including from lower-cost foreign competitors. Share prices of such
            companies, especially smaller or less-seasoned issuers, tend to be
            more volatile than the broader market. Many information technology
            companies depend on patents and other intellectual property; loss,
            impairment, or adverse enforcement of those rights (or allegations
            of infringement) could negatively affect their operating results and
            valuations. Supply-chain constraints, shortages of key inputs, and
            challenges attracting and retaining specialized talent may further
            pressure profitability.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <b>Third Party Data Risk.</b> The Index relies on information from
        third-party data vendors (e.g., prices, shares outstanding, free float,
        sector classifications, and corporate actions) and on calculations
        performed by an independent index calculator, Solactive AG (the "Index
        Calculator"). The Adviser (or an affiliate), as owner of the Index
        intellectual property, determines constituents and weights pursuant to
        the Index rules, including assessments of founder-led status based on
        public and other sources. Errors, delays, or misapplications by any
        party - data vendors, the Index Calculator, or the Adviser (or
        affiliate) - may result in unintended inclusions/exclusions, inaccurate
        weights, or delayed implementation of changes. Until corrected, such
        issues may cause the Fund to deviate from intended exposures and from
        the Index's published values. Solactive, as calculation agent, may use
        third-party data to calculate and maintain the Index, and certain data
        providers impose licensing and disclosure requirements. If required
        licenses are not in place or are revoked, or if a third-party data
        provider materially restricts use or significantly increases fees, Index
        calculation or dissemination may be interrupted or terminated on short
        notice.
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>Tracking Error Risk.</b> The Fund's results may differ from the Index
        because the Fund bears fees and trading costs the Index does not; at
        times the Fund may hold cash or positions not in the Index, or may not
        be fully invested in Index constituents.
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>Third-Party Data & Publication Risk.</b> The Index (and therefore the
        Fund) depends on third-party data and calculations. Neither the Fund's
        investment adviser nor the Index Calculator guarantees uninterrupted or
        timely index production or publication. The calculation and
        dissemination of Index values can be delayed or interrupted if the
        calculation agent, data vendors, or a relevant stock exchange
        experiences a malfunction or outage. Index values may be delayed by
        technology outages or other operational issues. If index publication is
        interrupted due to data or systems issues, trading in Shares could be
        disrupted or halted. Prolonged interruptions could lead to trading halts
        in Shares, which may have an adverse impact on the Fund and its
        shareholders.

        <b>Investment Adviser</b>
        <br />
        <br />
        Corgi Strategies, LLC (the "Adviser"), located at 473 Pine St, Floor 5,
        San Francisco, CA 94104, is a Delaware limited liability company seeking
        registration with the SEC as an investment adviser and serves as
        investment adviser to the Fund. The Adviser was founded in July 2025,
        and as of [ ], 2025, has no prior assets under management and has not
        served as the investment adviser or sub-adviser for any other registered
        funds.
        <br />
        <br />
        The Adviser is responsible for overall portfolio management and
        administration of the Fund pursuant to an investment advisory agreement
        with Corgi ETF Trust I (the "Trust") (the "Advisory Agreement"). In
        addition to executing portfolio transactions, the Adviser may arrange
        for, and oversee, service providers performing transfer agency, custody,

        necessary for the Fund's operations.
        <br />
        <br />
        For its services to the Fund, the Fund pays the Adviser a unitary
        management fee, calculated daily and paid monthly, at an annual rate of
        0.49% of the Fund's average daily net assets. Under the Advisory
        Agreement, the Adviser pays substantially all of the Fund's expenses
        except for: the advisory fee itself; interest charges on borrowings;
        taxes; brokerage commissions and other expenses related to buying and
        selling portfolio investments; dividends and other expenses on
        securities sold short; acquired fund fees and expenses; any accrued
        deferred tax liability; distribution fees and expenses under any Rule
        12b-1 plan; litigation and other extraordinary expenses; and any other
        expenses the Fund is responsible for under the Advisory Agreement
        (collectively, the "Excluded Expenses").

        <b>HOW TO BUY AND SELL SHARES</b>
        <br />
        <br />
        The Fund issues and redeems Shares only in large blocks called "Creation
        Units," at the Fund's net asset value ("NAV") next determined after an
        order is accepted. Only authorized participants ("APs"), who must be
        members or participants of a registered clearing agency and must have an
        executed participant agreement with the Fund's distributor and transfer
        agent, may transact in Creation Units directly with the Fund. Once
        created, Shares may be bought and sold in the secondary market in
        amounts less than a Creation Unit.
        <br />
        <br />
        Most investors buy and sell Shares in secondary-market transactions
        through brokers. Shares are expected to be listed for trading on [ ]
        (the "Exchange") and can be bought and sold throughout the trading day
        at market prices. Investors may pay customary brokerage commissions and,
        because secondary-market transactions occur at market prices, investors
        may pay more than NAV when buying Shares and receive less than NAV when
        selling Shares.
      </div>

      <br />

      <div align="LEFT">
        <b>Book Entry</b>
        <br />
        <br />
        Shares are held only in book-entry form. The Depository Trust Company
        ("DTC") or its nominee is the record owner of all outstanding Shares.
        Beneficial ownership of Shares is shown on the records of DTC or its
        participants (e.g., brokers, banks, and other financial institutions).
        As a beneficial owner, you will not receive physical certificates and
        must rely on DTC and its participants to exercise rights associated with
        owning Shares, consistent with standard "street name" procedures.

      <div align="LEFT">
        <b>Frequent Purchases and Redemptions of Shares</b>
        <br />
        <br />
        The Fund does not impose restrictions on the frequency of purchases and
        redemptions of Shares. Purchases and redemptions by APs are integral to
        the ETF arbitrage mechanism and help keep market prices of Shares close
        to NAV. The Board has considered the potential for frequent purchases
        and redemptions, particularly for cash, to increase portfolio
        transaction costs, tracking difference, and realized capital gains, and
        has approved policies to mitigate these effects, including fair-value
        pricing and the imposition of transaction fees on Creation Unit
        purchases and redemptions designed to cover the Fund's costs. The Fund
        and the Adviser reserve the right to reject any purchase order at any
        time.

      <div align="LEFT">
        <b>Determination of Net Asset Value</b>
        <br />
        <br />
        The Fund's NAV is calculated as of the close of regular trading on [ ]
        (normally 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time) on each day the Exchange is open for
        business. NAV is computed by dividing the Fund's net assets by the
        number of Shares outstanding.
        <br />
        <br />
        In determining NAV, portfolio securities and other assets are generally
        valued at market value using quotations, last sale prices, or values
        supplied by a pricing service or market makers. When such information is
        unavailable or is deemed unreliable, the affected investments are valued
        at fair value pursuant to the Fund's valuation procedures.
      </div>

      <br />

      <div align="LEFT">
        <b>Fair Value Pricing</b>
        <br />
        <br />
        The Board has designated the Adviser as the Fund's "valuation designee"
        under Rule 2a-5 of the 1940 Act, subject to the Board's oversight. The
        Adviser has adopted valuation policies and procedures to determine, in
        good faith, the fair value of investments for which market quotations
        are not readily available or are considered unreliable (for example,
        following a trading halt or when a primary pricing source fails to
        provide data). In making fair-value determinations, the Adviser may
        consider all reasonably available information deemed relevant, including
        issuer-specific data, market conditions, recent trading activity, and
        the circumstances that triggered the need for fair value. Because fair
        value determinations involve judgments, the prices assigned may differ
        from values realized upon sale.

        Investments by registered investment companies in the Fund are subject
        to the limits of Section 12(d)(1) of the 1940 Act and related rules.
        Other registered investment companies may invest in the Fund beyond the
        Section 12(d)(1) limits in accordance with applicable SEC rules (e.g.,

        <b>DIVIDENDS, DISTRIBUTIONS, AND TAXES</b>
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>Dividends and Distributions</b>
        <br />
        <br />
        The Fund intends to pay dividends and interest income, if any, annually,
        and to distribute any net realized capital gains to shareholders at
        least annually. The Fund will declare and pay income and capital gain
        distributions, if any, in cash. Cash distributions may be reinvested in
        additional whole Shares only if the broker through whom you hold Shares
        offers that option. Your broker is responsible for delivering any income
        and capital gain distributions to you.
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>Taxes</b>
        <br />
        <br />
        The following discussion summarizes certain U.S. federal income tax
        considerations that generally apply to investments in the Fund. Your
        situation may differ. You should consult your tax adviser regarding the
        tax consequences of investing in Shares, including the application of
        foreign, state, and local tax laws.
        <br />
        <br />
        The Fund intends to qualify each year as a regulated investment company
        ("RIC") under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the
        "Code"). If the Fund satisfies minimum distribution requirements, a RIC
        is generally not subject to fund-level federal income tax on income and
        gains that are timely distributed to shareholders. If the Fund were to
        fail to qualify as a RIC or fail to meet the distribution requirements
        (and no relief were available), it could be subject to fund-level
        taxation, which would reduce income available for distribution.
        <br />
        <br />
        Unless your Shares are held through a tax-exempt entity or
        tax-advantaged account (such as an IRA), you should consider potential
        tax consequences when the Fund makes distributions, when you sell Shares
        on the Exchange, and (for institutional investors only) when you
        purchase or redeem Creation Units.
        <br />
        <br />
        This general discussion is based on the Code and applicable Treasury
        regulations in effect on the date of this Prospectus. New legislation,
        administrative guidance, or court decisions may materially change these
        conclusions and may apply retroactively.
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>Taxes on Distributions</b>
        <br />
        <br />
        For federal income tax purposes, distributions of the Fund's net
        investment income are generally taxable to shareholders as ordinary
        income or as qualified dividend income. Tax treatment of distributions
        of net capital gains (if any) depends on how long the Fund held the
        investments that generated such gains, not on how long you have held
        your Shares. Sales of assets held by the Fund for more than one year
        generally produce long-term capital gains or losses; sales of assets
        held for one year or less generally produce short-term capital gains or
        losses. Distributions that the Fund reports as capital gain dividends
        ("Capital Gain Dividends") are taxable to shareholders as long-term
        capital gains. Distributions of short-term capital gains are generally
        taxable to shareholders as ordinary income. Dividends and distributions
        are generally taxable to you whether received in cash or reinvested in
        additional Shares.
        <br />
        <br />
        Distributions the Fund reports as "qualified dividend income" are
        generally taxed to non-corporate shareholders at the rates applicable to
        long-term capital gains, provided holding-period and other requirements
        are met. "Qualified dividend income" generally includes dividends from
        U.S. corporations and from certain qualified foreign corporations
        (including those incorporated in a U.S. possession, eligible for
        benefits under a comprehensive U.S. income tax treaty, or whose stock is
        readily tradable on an established U.S. market). Corporate shareholders
        may be eligible for a dividends-received deduction with respect to
        portions of dividends attributable to qualifying dividends the Fund
        receives from U.S. corporations, subject to applicable limitations.
        <br />
        <br />
        Shortly after the close of each calendar year, you will receive
        information describing the character of distributions you received from
        the Fund.
        <br />
        <br />
        In addition to federal income tax, certain individuals, trusts, and
        estates are subject to a 3.8% Net Investment Income ("NII") tax. This
        tax is imposed on the lesser of: (i) net investment income (as reduced
        by properly allocable deductions) or (ii) the excess of modified
        adjusted gross income over specified thresholds ($250,000 for married
        filing jointly, $200,000 for single filers, and $125,000 for married
        filing separately). The Fund's distributions and any capital gains
        realized on a sale or redemption of Shares are generally included in net
        investment income for purposes of the NII tax.
        <br />
        <br />
        In general, distributions are taxable to you in the year paid. However,
        certain distributions paid in January may be treated as paid on December
        31 of the year prior. In general, distributions are taxable even if they
        are paid from income or gains earned by the Fund before you purchased
        Shares (and thus were reflected in the Shares' NAV at the time of
        purchase).
        <br />
        <br />
        You may want to avoid purchasing Shares immediately before a dividend or
        other distribution, since the distribution will generally be taxable to
        you even if, in economic terms, it represents a return of part of your
        investment.
        <br />
        <br />
        If you are neither a U.S. citizen nor a U.S. resident (or are a foreign
        entity), distributions (other than Capital Gain Dividends) will
        generally be subject to U.S. withholding tax at a 30% rate, unless a
        lower treaty rate applies. Under certain circumstances, the Fund may
        report all or a portion of a dividend as an "interest-related dividend"
        or a "short-term capital gain dividend," which would generally be exempt
        from this 30% withholding tax, provided other requirements are met.
        <br />
        <br />
        The Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act ("FATCA") may require the Fund to
        withhold a 30% tax (generally not refundable) from distributions of net
        investment income made to: (A) certain foreign financial institutions
        that do not satisfy applicable FATCA reporting or due-diligence
        requirements (or that are not treated as compliant under an applicable
        intergovernmental agreement), and (B) certain non-financial foreign
        entities that do not provide required information regarding substantial
        U.S. owners. FATCA may also affect the Fund's returns on foreign
        investments or a shareholder's returns if Shares are held through a
        foreign intermediary. Consult your tax adviser regarding FATCA's
        application and any related certification, compliance, reporting, and
        withholding obligations.
        <br />
        <br />
        The Fund (or a financial intermediary, such as a broker, through which a
        shareholder holds Shares) is generally required to withhold and remit to
        the U.S. Treasury a portion of taxable distributions and sale or
        redemption proceeds if the shareholder fails to furnish a correct
        taxpayer identification number, has underreported certain interest or
        dividend income, or fails to certify that they are not subject to such
        withholding.
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>Taxes When Shares are Sold on the Exchange</b>
        <br />
        <br />
        Any capital gain or loss realized upon a sale of Shares generally is
        treated as long-term capital gain or loss if Shares have been held for
        more than one year, and as short-term capital gain or loss if Shares
        have been held for one year or less. However, a capital loss on Shares
        held six months or less is treated as long-term to the extent of Capital
        Gain Dividends received with respect to such Shares. Losses are
        disallowed to the extent you acquire (including through dividend
        reinvestment) substantially identical Shares within a 61-day period
        beginning 30 days before and ending 30 days after the sale.

        <br />
        <b>Taxes on Purchases and Redemptions of Creation Units</b>
        <br />
        <br />
        An authorized participant ("AP") whose functional currency is the U.S.
        dollar and who exchanges securities for Creation Units generally
        recognizes gain or loss equal to the difference between (i) the value of
        the Creation Units at the time of the exchange and (ii) the AP's
        aggregate basis in the securities delivered plus any cash paid. An AP
        that exchanges Creation Units for securities will generally recognize
        gain or loss equal to the difference between (i) the AP's basis in the
        Creation Units and (ii) the aggregate U.S. dollar market value of the
        securities received plus any cash received. The IRS may assert that a
        loss realized upon an exchange of securities for Creation Units is not
        currently deductible (e.g., under the "wash sale" rules for an AP not
        marking to market, or on the theory that there was no significant change
        in economic position). APs should consult their own tax advisers about
        the application of wash sale rules and the timing of any loss
        deductions.
        <br />
        <br />
        Any capital gain or loss realized upon redemption of Creation Units is
        generally treated as long-term capital gain or loss if the Shares
        comprising the Creation Units were held for more than one year, and as
        short-term capital gain or loss if held for one year or less.
        <br />
        <br />
        The Fund may include a payment of cash in addition to, or in place of,
        delivering a basket of securities when redeeming Creation Units. To
        raise cash for such redemptions, the Fund may sell portfolio securities,
        potentially recognizing investment income and/or capital gains or losses
        it might not have recognized if the redemption had been satisfied
        entirely in kind. As a result, including cash in redemption proceeds can
        reduce the Fund's tax efficiency.
        <br />
        <br />
        The foregoing discussion summarizes some possible consequences under
        current federal tax law of investing in the Fund. It is not a substitute
        for personal tax advice. You may also be subject to foreign, state, and
        local taxes on Fund distributions and on sales of Shares. Consult your
        tax adviser regarding the tax consequences of investing in Shares under
        all applicable laws. For additional information, see "Federal Income
        Taxes" in the SAI.

        <b>DISTRIBUTION</b>
        <br />
        <br />
        [ ] (the "Distributor"), the Fund's distributor, is a broker-dealer
        registered with the SEC, serves as the Fund's distributor for Creation
        Units on an agency basis and does not make a secondary market in Shares.
        The Distributor does not set Fund policies or select the portfolio
        securities of the Fund. The Distributor's principal address is [ ].
        <br />
        <br />
        The Board has adopted a Distribution (Rule 12b-1) Plan (the "Plan")
        pursuant to Rule 12b-1 under the 1940 Act. Under the Plan, the Fund is
        authorized to pay up to 0.25% of its average daily net assets each year
        for distribution-related services in connection with the sale and
        distribution of its Shares.
        <br />
        <br />
        The Fund does not currently pay Rule 12b-1 fees and there are no current
        plans to impose such fees. If Rule 12b-1 fees are charged in the future,
        because they are paid from Fund assets on an ongoing basis, these fees
        would increase the cost of your investment over time and may exceed
        certain other types of sales charges.

        The Agreement and Declaration of Trust (the "Declaration of Trust") sets
        forth a detailed process for shareholders to bring derivative or direct
        actions, designed to permit legitimate claims while limiting the costs,
        distraction, and other harm that can result from spurious demands and
        derivative actions. Before bringing a derivative action, a demand by
        three unrelated shareholders must be made to the Fund's Trustees. The
        Declaration of Trust specifies required information, certifications,
        undertakings, and acknowledgments that must accompany such a demand.
        Upon receiving a demand, the Trustees have 90 days, extendable by an
        additional 60 days, to consider it. If a majority of the Trustees who
        are independent for purposes of considering the demand determine that
        pursuing the requested action is not in the best interests of the Fund,
        they must reject the demand, and the complaining shareholders may not
        proceed with a derivative action unless they can demonstrate to a court
        that the Trustees' decision was not a good-faith exercise of business
        judgment on the Fund's behalf. In addition, shareholders owning Shares
        representing no less than a majority of the Fund's outstanding shares
        must join in bringing any derivative action. If a demand is rejected,
        the complaining shareholders may be responsible for the Fund's costs and
        expenses (including attorneys' fees) incurred in considering the demand
        if a court determines that the demand was made without reasonable cause
        or for an improper purpose. If a derivative action is brought in
        violation of the Declaration of Trust, the shareholders bringing the
        action may be responsible for the Fund's costs, including attorneys'
        fees, if a court determines that the action was brought without
        reasonable cause or for an improper purpose. The Declaration of Trust
        provides that no shareholder may bring a direct action alleging injury
        as a shareholder of the Trust or any Fund where the matters alleged
        would, if true, give rise to a claim belonging to the Trust (or the
        Trust on behalf of the Fund), unless the shareholder has suffered a harm
        distinct from that of other shareholders. A shareholder bringing a
        direct claim must be a shareholder of the Fund at the time of the
        alleged injury or must have acquired the shares by operation of law from
        a person who was also a shareholder as of that time. The Declaration of
        Trust further provides that the Fund will pay attorneys' fees and legal
        expenses incurred by a complaining shareholder only if required by law,
        and any attorneys' fees the Fund is obligated to pay will be calculated
        using reasonable hourly rates. These provisions do not apply to claims
        brought under the federal securities laws.
        <br />
        <br />
        The Declaration of Trust provides that shareholder actions against the
        Fund must be filed exclusively in state or federal courts located in
        Delaware. This forum provision does not apply to claims under the
        federal securities laws. Limiting actions to courts in Delaware may
        impose economic hardship on shareholders (e.g., travel costs, the need
        to retain local counsel) and may limit access to a forum some
        shareholders would otherwise prefer, which could discourage such
        actions.

      <br />

      <div align="LEFT">
        <a name="fdrx-investment-objective"></a>
        <b>Investment Objective</b>
        <br />
        The Founder-Led 2x Daily ETF (the "Fund") seeks daily investment
        results, before fees and expenses, that correspond to two times (2x) the
        daily performance of the Founder-Led Index (the "Index"). The Fund does
        not aim to achieve 2x of the Index for any period other than a single
        day, measured from one NAV calculation to the next.
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>Important information about the Fund.</b> On a day when the Index
        rises, the Fund is designed to gain roughly twice as much as the Index.
        On a day when the Index falls, the Fund is designed to lose roughly
        twice as much as the Index. Because the Fund resets its exposure each
        trading day, performance over periods longer than one day will reflect
        the effects of compounding and may differ, sometimes significantly, from
        2x the Index return for the same period. The degree of difference will
        depend on factors that include:
        <br />
        - the magnitude of day to day Index moves,
        <br />
        - the volatility and path of Index returns, and
        <br />
        - how long shares are held.
        <br />
        <br />
        In general, higher volatility and frequent directional reversals in the
        Index tend to reduce the Fund's return relative to 2x of the Index over
        time, while strong, steadier trends may result in returns that are
        closer to, or occasionally greater than, 2x for the same period. The
        Fund expects to use derivatives, such as swaps and futures, and other
        instruments to obtain its leveraged exposure. The Fund may be suitable
        only for investors who understand the consequences of daily leverage and
        who intend to actively monitor and manage their investment.
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>Fees and Expenses of the Fund</b>
        <br />
        The table below describes the fees and expenses that you may pay if you

        <b>Portfolio Turnover</b>
        <br />
        The Fund pays transaction costs, such as commissions, when it buys and
        sells securities (or "turns over" its portfolio). A higher portfolio
        turnover rate generally leads to higher trading costs and, in taxable
        accounts, may increase taxable distributions. These costs are not
        included in the total annual fund operating expenses or in the Example
        and reduce performance. Because the Fund is newly organized, portfolio
        turnover information is not yet available.
        <br />

      <br />

      <div align="LEFT">
        <b>Principal Investment Strategies</b>
        <br />
        <br />
        The Fund is an exchange traded fund that seeks, for a single day,
        investment results, before fees and expenses, that correspond to 2x the
        daily performance of the Founder-Led Index (the "Index"). The Fund
        follows a passive approach designed to deliver a multiple of the Index's
        daily move rather than to outperform the Index.
        <br />
        <br />
        To pursue its 2x Daily Objective, the Fund expects to obtain most of its
        exposure through derivatives, including total return swaps on the Index
        and on baskets of Index constituents, and may also use exchange-traded
        equity index futures and other equity-linked instruments. From time to
        time, and when operationally efficient, the Fund may hold some Index
        constituents directly.
        <br />
        <br />
        In connection with its derivative positions, the Fund will maintain cash
        and cash equivalents, such as U.S. Treasury bills and repurchase
        agreements, for collateral, liquidity, and portfolio management.
        <br />
        <br />
        Under normal circumstances, the Fund will invest at least 80% of its net
        assets, plus any borrowings for investment purposes, in securities of
        founder-led companies included in the Index and/or in financial
        instruments (for example, swaps and futures) that, in the aggregate,
        provide leveraged exposure to such companies.
        <br />
        <br />
        The Index measures the performance of U.S. publicly traded, founder-led
        companies. The Index is owned and administered by Corgi Strategies, LLC
        (the "Index Owner"), which sets the eligibility rules, selection
        process, and weighting framework. Solactive AG (the "Index Calculator")
        serves as calculation agent and publishes Index values on behalf of the
        Index Owner. Additional details about the Index appear below under "The
        Index".
      </div>

      <br />

      <div align="LEFT">
        <h3>The Index</h3>
        <b>I. Eligible Universe</b>
        <br />
        The Index's eligible universe includes common equity securities of
        U.S.-listed companies with primary listings only (excluding American
        Depositary Receipts and over-the-counter securities).
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>II. Constituent Selection</b>
        <br />
        From the eligible universe, companies are screened to identify
        founder-led issuers, meaning companies where at least one original
        founder currently serves in a C-suite or equivalent key executive role
        (e.g., CEO, Executive Chair, President, CTO, CFO). Among these
        founder-led issuers, the Index selects 50 companies using free float
        adjusted market capitalization and liquidity criteria.
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>III. Weighting</b>
        <br />
        Constituents are weighted by free float adjusted market value, subject
        to a maximum of 10% per issuer as of each Rebalance Day. If the Index
        becomes concentrated in a particular sector or industry, the Fund is
        expected to mirror that concentration.
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>IV. Rebalancing</b>
        <br />
        The Index is reconstituted and rebalanced quarterly after the close on
        the third Friday of March, June, September, and December, with changes
        effective on the next trading day (each, a "Rebalance Day"). The 10%
        single issuer cap is applied at each Rebalance Day.
        <br />
        <br />
        Between scheduled rebalances, if any constituent's closing weight rises
        above 20%, that name is reset to 10% and the excess weight is spread
        across the remaining constituents on a pro rata basis. This drift
        control can result in interim adjustments outside of the regular
        quarterly schedule. These interim adjustments may trigger additional
        transaction costs in the Fund during replication/sampling (see "Index
        Rebalancing Risk").
        <br />
      </div>

      <br />

      <div align="LEFT">
        <h3>The Fund's Investment Strategy</h3>
        The Fund seeks to deliver 2x the Index's daily return, before fees and
        expenses, by maintaining leveraged exposure that is reset each trading
        day. As the Index and the Fund's net assets change during the day, the
        portfolio is adjusted, typically around the time the Fund calculates its
        NAV, to bring exposure back toward 2x of net assets for the next trading
        day.
        <br />
        <br />
        Under normal circumstances, the Fund will be investing at least 80% of
        its net assets, plus any borrowings for investment purposes, in equity
        securities of founder-led companies and/or financial instruments (such
        as swaps) that provide indirect exposure to founder-led companies.
        <br />
        <br />
        The Fund generally uses a replication approach, seeking to hold
        (directly or indirectly) each Index component in approximately the same
        weight as in the Index. When full replication is impracticable or
        inefficient (for example, due to liquidity, transaction costs, trading
        restrictions, or other considerations), the Fund may instead employ
        representative sampling by investing in a subset of securities and/or
        instruments with aggregate characteristics (including risk and return)
        similar to those of the Index as a whole.
        <br />
        <br />
        To the extent the Index concentrates in a particular industry or group
        of industries, the Fund will concentrate its investments to
        approximately the same extent.
        <br />
        <br />
        The Fund is classified as non-diversified under the Investment Company
        Act of 1940.
        <br />
      </div>

      <br />

      <div align="LEFT">
        <b>Principal Risks of Investing in the Fund</b>
        <br /><br />
        The principal risks are presented in alphabetical order to make
        comparison easier across funds. Each risk described below is considered
        a "principal risk" of investing in the Fund, regardless of its order. As
        with any investment, you could lose all or part of your investment. Any
        of these risks could adversely affect the Fund's net asset value
        ("NAV"), market price, yield, total return, and/or its ability to
        achieve its objective.
        <br /><br />
        <b>AP and Market Maker Dependence Risk.</b>
        The Fund relies on a limited number of authorized participants ("APs")
        and market makers to create, redeem, and provide liquidity in Shares. If
        these firms curtail or cease their activities and others do not step in,
        Shares may trade at significant premiums/discounts to NAV, experience
        wider bid-ask spreads, or be subject to trading halts or delisting.
        <br /><br />
        <b>Brokerage Commissions and Bid-Ask Spread Risk.</b>
        Investors transacting in the secondary market will pay brokerage
        commissions and may bear costs associated with the bid-ask spread. These
        costs tend to rise when trading volume is low or markets are stressed
        and can materially reduce investment results, especially for frequent or
        small transactions.
        <br /><br />
        <b>Concentration in Founder-Led Companies Risk.</b>
        Because the Index focuses on companies led by one or more original
        founders, the Fund's holdings may reflect governance practices,
        strategic choices, and corporate cultures that differ from peers. This
        thematic focus narrows the investable universe and may cause performance
        to differ—positively or negatively—from broader equity markets.
        <br /><br />
        <b>Control and Dual-Class Share Structures Risk.</b>
        Some founder-led issuers employ control mechanisms (e.g., dual-class
        voting) that concentrate voting power. Such structures can entrench
        management, reduce responsiveness to public shareholders, or amplify the
        market impact of founder-specific decisions or controversies.
        <br /><br />
        <b>Correlation Risk.</b> The Fund seeks approximately 2x the daily
        performance of the Index but may not achieve perfect leveraged
        correlation. Fees and expenses, transaction and financing costs, the use
        of derivatives, market disruptions, corporate actions, sampling, and
        limitations on rebalancing can all cause performance to deviate from the
        2x Daily Objective. <br /><br />
        <b>Counterparty Risk.</b> The Fund expects to use swap agreements and
        other over-the-counter instruments with financial institutions. The Fund
        could lose money if a counterparty fails to perform its obligations. In
        stressed markets, a counterparty may have contractual rights to
        terminate or substantially amend transactions, which could impair the
        Fund's ability to maintain targeted exposure. <br /><br />
        <b>Index Calculation & Methodology Risk.</b>
        Mistakes in index data, calculations, or application of the methodology
        can occur and may not be promptly remedied, which can affect the Fund.
        Errors, delays, or methodology misapplications—such as in classifying
        founder-led status, share counts, corporate actions, or float
        adjustments—may cause unintended inclusions/exclusions or inaccurate
        weights until corrected. Under the Index Calculation Agreement,
        Solactive does not serve as the index "administrator" and is engaged
        solely to calculate, maintain, and disseminate Index Levels in line with
        the methodology provided by the Index Owner; in cases not covered or not
        clearly regulated by the methodology, the Index Owner and Solactive
        consult to agree on treatment, and Solactive may, if guidance is not
        timely available, implement adjustments in its commercially reasonable
        judgment.
        <br /><br />
        <b>Early Close/Late Close/Trading Halt Risk.</b> An exchange or market
        may close early, close late, or halt trading in specific securities or
        instruments. In such cases, the Fund may be unable to rebalance, may be
        unable to accurately price its holdings, and could incur substantial
        trading costs or losses. <br /><br />
        <b>Equity Securities Risk.</b>
        Equity securities fluctuate in value due to issuer-specific events,
        sector dynamics, and broad market conditions. Common stocks generally
        exhibit greater volatility than preferred stocks or debt securities and
        may experience sudden declines or extended downturns.
        <br /><br />
        <b>Exchange Listing and Trading Risk.</b>
        Although Shares are expected to be listed on [ ] (the "Exchange"), there
        is no assurance of active or liquid trading. Market volatility, trading
        halts, systems outages, or limited market-making activity may impair the
        ability to transact in Shares at or near NAV.
        <br /><br />
        <b>Geopolitical and Macro Events Risk.</b>
        Changes in interest and inflation rates, economic slowdowns,
        supply-chain disruptions, public-health events, natural disasters, armed
        conflict, sanctions, and other policy actions can increase volatility
        and negatively affect the Fund's investments and secondary-market
        trading.
        <br /><br /><b>Holding Period and Compounding Risk.</b> The Fund seeks
        2x the Index's return for a single day, measured from one NAV
        calculation to the next. Over periods longer than one day, the effects
        of daily compounding, the path of Index returns, and Index volatility
        will likely cause the Fund's performance to differ, sometimes
        significantly, from 2x the Index return for the same period. During
        volatile or frequently reversing markets, returns may be lower than 2x
        the Index return for the period, and you could lose money even if the
        Index is flat or rises over the holding period. <br /><br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>Index Ownership and Conflicts of Interest Risk.</b>
        The Adviser (or an affiliate) owns the Index intellectual property and
        licenses it to the Fund. Although the Adviser does not receive
        index-licensing revenue from the Fund, conflicts could arise in index
        rule design, constituent determinations, or timing of rebalances. The
        Trust maintains information-barrier policies and Board oversight;
        however, such measures may not fully eliminate perceived or actual
        conflicts.
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>Index Performance Risk.</b> The Index may underperform other asset
        classes or other equity indices. The Index's methodology and founder-led
        focus may cause it to lag broader or differently constructed benchmarks
        over certain periods.
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>Intraday Price Performance Risk.</b> Shares trade intraday at market
        prices that may differ from the Fund's end-of-day NAV. Performance for
        Shares purchased or sold during the day will reflect market movements
        until the next NAV calculation and may be higher or lower than the
        Fund's daily objective over that sub-day interval.
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>Large-Capitalization Companies Risk.</b>
        Large-cap issuers can be slower to adapt to competitive or technological
        shifts and, in some environments, may underperform smaller companies
        that are more nimble.
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>Leverage Risk.</b> The Fund uses leverage to target approximately 2x
        the Index's daily return. Losses are magnified relative to the Index. If
        the Index declines by around 50% during a trading day, the Fund could
        experience a near-total or total loss. The use of leverage increases
        volatility and the risk of rapid losses. Costs of obtaining and
        maintaining leverage, including financing charges embedded in
        derivatives, will reduce returns.
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>Money Market Instruments Risk.</b> The Fund may hold cash and
        high-quality, short-term instruments such as U.S. Treasury bills and
        repurchase agreements for collateral and liquidity. Adverse economic,
        market, or regulatory events affecting these instruments or their
        counterparties, including repo counterparties, may negatively impact the
        Fund. Government guarantees, if any, apply only to the underlying
        securities and not to Shares of the Fund.
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>New Fund Risk.</b>
        The Fund is newly organized and has limited or no operating history. It
        may take time to attract assets, build secondary-market liquidity, and
        achieve efficient index tracking.
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>Non-Diversified Fund Risk.</b>
        As a non-diversified fund under the Investment Company Act of 1940, the
        Fund may invest a larger portion of assets in fewer issuers than a
        diversified fund. Losses in a single issuer could have a proportionately
        greater adverse effect on the Fund's performance.
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>Operational and Cybersecurity Risk.</b>
        The Fund and its service providers rely on complex processes and
        technology. Human error, processing or communication failures, cyber
        incidents, or disruptions at counterparties and other third parties
        could impair operations, result in financial loss, or hinder the Fund's
        ability to meet its objective.
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>Passive Strategy Risk.</b>
        The Fund is not actively managed. It seeks leveraged investment results
        that correspond to 2x the Index's daily performance and generally will
        not take defensive positions. During temporary defensive periods, the
        Fund will not seek to achieve its 2x daily objective. Performance may
        deviate from broad market returns or active strategies; the Fund will
        not attempt to mitigate declines in the Index.
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>Premium/Discount to NAV Risk.</b>
        Shares trade at market prices that may be above (premium) or below
        (discount) NAV, particularly when market volatility is elevated, trading
        volume is limited, or the Index/portfolio experiences disruptions.
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>Rebalance and Intra-Quarter Drift Adjustment Risk.</b>
        The Index applies a 10% single-stock cap at each scheduled quarterly
        rebalance and may implement out-of-cycle adjustments if a constituent's
        weight exceeds a 20% drift threshold (resetting to 10% and
        redistributing the excess pro rata). These actions can increase
        turnover, transaction costs, and taxable gains, and may contribute to
        tracking difference.
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>Sector/Industry Focus Risk.</b>
        Founder-led issuers may cluster in particular sectors or industries. If
        the Index becomes concentrated in any sector(s), the Fund will reflect
        that concentration and may be more sensitive to sector-specific
        developments than a more diversified approach.
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>Succession and Key-Person Exposure Risk.</b>
        The departure, reduced role, or loss of influence of a company's founder
        or other key executive may adversely affect the issuer's prospects and,
        in some cases, its continued eligibility for the Index, potentially
        leading to removals at reconstitution and additional turnover.
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>Swap Agreements and Other Derivatives Risk.</b>
        To the extent the Fund uses derivatives (e.g., total return swaps) to
        obtain exposure or for portfolio management, it is subject to
        counterparty, liquidity, valuation, leverage, and correlation risks.
        Derivatives can be more volatile than direct holdings and may increase
        exposure to certain market risks.
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>Tracking Difference and Tracking Error Risk.</b>
        The Fund's results may differ from those of the Index for various
        reasons. The Fund bears operating expenses and portfolio transaction
        costs that the Index does not. The Fund may not be fully invested in
        Index constituents at all times, may hold securities not included in the
        Index, and may experience timing differences, cash holdings, corporate
        actions, tax considerations, or fair-value pricing that contribute to
        tracking difference.

        The Fund has not operated for a full calendar year as of the date of
        this Prospectus, so performance data is not shown. After one full
        calendar year of operations, this section will include a calendar-year
        bar chart and a table of average annual total returns to illustrate how
        results vary over time and to compare the Fund's performance with that
        of the Index and a broad market benchmark. Because the Fund seeks 2x the
        daily performance of the Index, results for periods longer than a day
        will reflect compounding and may differ, potentially materially, from 2x
        the Index return for the same period. Past performance (before and after
        taxes) does not guarantee future results. When available, updated
        performance information will be posted on the Fund's website at
        www.founderledfunds.com.

        <b>Purchase and Sale of Shares</b>
        <br />
        <br />
        The Fund issues and redeems shares only in large blocks called "Creation
        Units" at NAV next determined after an order is accepted. Only
        authorized participants ("APs") may transact in Creation Units directly
        with the Fund. Creation Units are generally issued and redeemed in
        exchange for a basket of securities and/or cash; the Fund may, in its
        discretion, permit or require all-cash creations or redemptions.
        <br />
        <br />
        Individual Shares are listed for trading on [ ] (the "Exchange") and may
        be bought or sold in the secondary market at market prices rather than
        at NAV. Market prices may be above (premium to) or below (discount to)
        NAV. Investors trading on an exchange will pay brokerage commissions and
        may be affected by the bid-ask spread.
        <br />
        <br />
        As available, information required by Rule 6c-11 (including the Fund's
        NAV, market price, historical premiums/discounts, and median bid-ask
        spread) will be posted on the Fund's website at www.founderledfunds.com.

        <br />
        <b>Tax Information</b>
        <br />
        <br />
        Fund distributions are generally taxable to shareholders as ordinary
        income, qualified dividend income, and/or capital gains (or some
        combination), unless shares are held through an individual retirement
        account ("IRA") or other tax-advantaged arrangement, in which case taxes
        may be due upon withdrawal. Your tax treatment may vary; consult your
        tax adviser about your particular circumstances.
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>Financial Intermediary Compensation</b>
        <br />
        <br />
        If you purchase Shares through a financial intermediary (e.g., a
        broker-dealer or bank), the Adviser or its affiliates may, from their
        own resources, compensate the intermediary for activities related to the
        distribution, marketing, promotion, or sale of Shares, or for
        shareholder and educational support. These payments may create a
        conflict of interest by incentivizing the intermediary or its personnel
        to recommend the Fund over other investments. Such payments are not made
        by the Fund and do not increase the expenses paid by the Fund. Ask your
        salesperson or visit your intermediary's website for more information.

        <h3>ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT THE FUND</h3>
        <b>Investment Objective</b>
        <br />
        <br />
        The Founder-Led 2x Daily ETF (the "Fund") seeks daily investment
        results, before fees and expenses, that correspond to 2x the daily
        performance of the Founder-Led Index (the "Index"). A "single day" is
        measured from one NAV calculation to the next. <br />
        <br />
        The Fund does not seek to achieve 2x the performance of the Index for
        periods greater than a day. Over holding periods longer than a day, the
        effects of daily rebalancing and compounding can cause returns to
        differ, sometimes materially, from 2x the Index return for the same
        period. During volatile or reversing markets, you may lose money even if
        the Index is flat or rises over your holding period. <br />
        <br />
        An investment objective is fundamental if it cannot be changed without
        the approval of a "majority of the outstanding voting securities" (as
        defined in the Investment Company Act of 1940). The Fund's investment
        objective is not fundamental and may be changed by the Board of Trustees
        (the "Board") of Corgi ETF Trust I (the "Trust") upon 60 days' prior
        written notice to shareholders.
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>Principal Investment Strategies</b>
        <br />
        <br />
        The Fund's policy to invest, under normal market conditions, at least
        80% of its net assets (plus any borrowings for investment purposes) in
        equity securities of founder-led companies and/or in financial
        instruments that provide economic exposure to founder-led companies is
        non-fundamental and may be changed by the Board upon 60 days' prior
        written notice to shareholders. For purposes of the Fund's 80% policy,
        the Fund will measure assets including the notional value of derivatives
        (adjusted as required) consistent with Rule 35d-1.
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>The Index</b>
        <br />
        <br />
        The Index is owned by Corgi Strategies, LLC and licensed for use by the
        Fund. The Adviser does not receive index-licensing revenue from the
        Fund. Because the Adviser (or an affiliate) owns the Index IP, this
        "self-indexing" arrangement presents potential conflicts of interest;
        the Trust maintains information-barrier policies and procedures, and the
        Board provides oversight of index-related processes.
        <br /><br />
        Solactive AG ("Index Calculator") acts as the calculation agent and
        index-maintenance and dissemination service provider (via a
        dissemination agent) for the Index. Solactive does not act as the Index
        "administrator".
        <br /><br />
        In summary, the Index screens U.S.-listed companies to identify
        founder-led issuers and selects the top 50 qualifying names by
        free-float market capitalization, subject to liquidity criteria.
        Constituents are weighted by free-float market capitalization, applying
        a 10% single-issuer cap on each Rebalance Day. Between Rebalance Days,
        if any constituent's closing weight exceeds 20%, it is reset to 10% and
        the excess weight is redistributed pro rata across the remaining
        constituents, subject to the methodology's constraints.
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>Rebalancing Schedule</b>
        <br />
        <br />
        The Index is reconstituted and rebalanced quarterly after the close on
        the third Friday of March, June, September, and December, with changes
        effective on the next trading day (each, a "Rebalance Day").
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>Manager of Managers Structure</b>
        <br />
        <br />
        The Fund does not currently employ a sub-adviser. The Adviser intends to
        seek exemptive relief from the SEC permitting the Adviser, subject to
        Board approval and applicable conditions, to appoint, replace, or
        materially amend agreements with unaffiliated sub-advisers without
        shareholder approval. Shareholders will be notified of any such changes
        as required. Any sub-advisory compensation will be paid by the Adviser
        and not by the Fund. The Adviser retains overall responsibility, under
        Board oversight, for supervising any sub-adviser(s), including
        selection, evaluation, and termination.

        <b>Understanding the Fund's Daily Objective and Compounding</b>
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>What the Fund seeks to do.</b> The Fund seeks daily investment
        results, before fees and expenses, that correspond to 2x the daily
        performance of the Index. The Fund does not seek to, and should not be
        expected to, provide 2x the return of the Index for periods longer than
        a single trading day.
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>What this means for holding periods longer than one day.</b> The Fund
        resets its exposure each trading day to target approximately two times
        the daily move of the Index. Over periods longer than one day, the
        Fund's return is the result of compounding its daily returns and will
        usually differ in amount, and may differ in direction, from 2x the
        return of the Index for the same multi-day period.
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>Why multi-day results differ from 2x.</b> Several factors contribute
        to this difference: <br />
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>Compounding and daily rebalancing.</b> Gains or losses on one day
            change the base to which the next day's 2x move is applied. This
            mathematical effect causes outcomes over time that diverge from
            simply taking 2x of a multi-day index return.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Index volatility.</b> Higher day-to-day variability in the Index
            generally increases the dispersion between the Fund's multi-day
            return and 2x the Index's multi-day return. The effect tends to be
            more pronounced as volatility rises.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Index trend.</b> When the Index trends steadily in one direction
            with low volatility, the Fund's multi-day return may be closer to or
            even exceed 2x the Index's multi-day return. In choppy or
            range-bound markets, the Fund's multi-day return will often be less
            than 2x.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Financing costs and expenses.</b> The cost of maintaining
            derivatives or other forms of leveraged exposure, together with Fund
            expenses, reduces returns relative to 2x the Index's performance.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Dividends and corporate actions.</b> Differences between how
            dividends and corporate events affect the Index level versus the
            Fund's instruments can also impact results.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <b>Important holding period note.</b> The Fund is intended for investors
        who plan to monitor and manage their positions, potentially as
        frequently as daily. It is possible to lose the entire amount invested
        in a single day. <br />
        <br />
        <b>Illustration of daily compounding.</b> The table below shows a simple
        5-day path. The Fund achieves exactly 2x of each day's Index move before
        fees and expenses. Even so, the 5-day total return of the Fund does not
        equal 2x the 5-day total return of the Index. This example is
        hypothetical and for illustration only. It assumes no dividends, no
        financing costs, and no Fund expenses. If those were included, the
        Fund's performance would be lower than shown. <br />

        Across five days, the Index gained approximately 3.0%, while the Fund
        gained approximately 5.8%, which differs from 2 x 3.0% (about 6.0%).
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>Additional simulations.</b> The Fund may present other hypothetical
        paths to show how volatility and trend can affect results. Unless
        otherwise noted, any such illustrations assume: (a) no dividends; (b) no
        Fund expenses; and (c) zero percent borrowing or lending rates. If these
        factors were reflected, results would differ. For any scenario analysis
        that references an assumed volatility rate, insert 16%, which may
        reference the approximate 5-year historical annualized volatility of a
        broad equity index for context. Historical volatility for the Index may
        differ materially from that reference figure. <br />
        <br />
        <b>Key takeaways for investors.</b> <br />
        <ul>
          <li>
            The Fund seeks 2x the daily performance of the Index for a single
            trading day, not for any other period.
          </li>
          <li>
            Over time, daily compounding, Index volatility, financing costs, and
            expenses will cause returns to deviate from 2x the Index's multi-day
            return.
          </li>
          <li>
            If the Index is flat over a period, the Fund will likely lose value
            due to daily rebalancing, financing costs, and expenses.
          </li>
          <li>
            Investors should actively monitor positions and consider whether
            frequent rebalancing is appropriate in light of their goals, risk
            tolerance, and tax considerations.

        <b>Principal Risks of Investing in the Fund</b>
        <br />
        <br />
        The principal risks are presented in alphabetical order to make it
        easier to locate specific risks and to compare them with those of other
        funds. Each risk summarized below is regarded as a "principal risk" of
        investing in the Fund, regardless of the order in which it appears.
        Investing involves risk, including the possible loss of principal. Any
        of the risks described can adversely affect the Fund's NAV, market
        price, income, or total return. Some or all of these risks may adversely
        affect the Fund's NAV per share price, yield, total return, and/or the
        Fund's ability to achieve its objective.
        <br />
        <br />
        The risks below could negatively affect the value of your investment in
        the Fund. Because the Fund seeks to deliver 2x the daily performance of
        the Index before fees and expenses, it is subject to additional risks
        associated with leverage, daily rebalancing, compounding, derivatives,
        and financing costs.
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>Compounding and Daily Rebalancing Risk.</b> The Fund seeks a multiple
        of the daily return of the Index, not of the Index's return for periods
        longer than one day. The Fund resets its exposure each trading day to
        target approximately 2x the Index's daily move. As a result, the Fund's
        performance over periods longer than one day will be the product of its
        daily returns for each day in the period, which can diverge in amount,
        and possibly in direction, from 2x the Index's return for the same
        multi-day period. In general, when Index volatility is higher, the
        impact of compounding and daily rebalancing will be more pronounced and
        the Fund's multi-day results will tend to be less than 2x the Index's
        return for the same period; when volatility is lower, multi-day results
        may be closer to or greater than 2x. If the Index is flat over time, the
        Fund will likely lose value due to the effects of daily resetting,
        compounding, financing costs, and expenses. An investor could lose the
        full principal value of an investment in the Fund within a single day.
        Deviations can occur over periods as short as one day when measured
        intraday rather than NAV to NAV.
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>Correlation Risk.</b> The Fund may not achieve a high degree of
        correlation with 2x the daily performance of the Index for a number of
        reasons, including, but not limited to, imperfect correlation between
        derivative instruments and the reference Index, the timing and size of
        daily rebalancing trades, market disruptions or closures, illiquidity in
        the markets for instruments used to obtain exposure, financing rates,
        dividend and corporate action differences, and the Fund's fees and
        expenses. Intraday Index movements, particularly those occurring near
        the close, can increase the likelihood that the Fund is materially
        under- or over-exposed at the end of the day.
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>Counterparty Risk.</b> The Fund expects to obtain exposure to the
        Index primarily through derivatives, including swaps and futures. The
        Fund is exposed to the risk that a derivatives counterparty or a
        clearinghouse or futures commission merchant will be unwilling or unable
        to honor its obligations. The Fund could lose margin or collateral it
        has posted, experience delays in recovery, or recover less than the full
        amount owed. Concentration of clearing services among a small number of
        firms and clearinghouses may increase this risk. Contractual provisions
        or resolution regimes could delay, limit, or eliminate the Fund's
        ability to exercise remedies.
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>Derivatives Risk.</b> The Fund may use derivatives such as total
        return swaps, futures contracts, options, and similar instruments to
        pursue its 2x daily objective. Derivatives can be volatile and may
        involve risks different from, and sometimes greater than, investing
        directly in the securities comprising the Index. Such risks include
        leverage, imperfect correlation with the Index, pricing and liquidity
        constraints, valuation complexity, and the potential that the cost to
        maintain a position exceeds its return. Limited initial margin may
        magnify losses, potentially beyond the amounts initially invested in the
        instrument.
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>Equity Market Risk.</b> Common stocks generally carry more risk than
        preferred stock or debt because common shareholders are lower in the
        capital structure. Equity holdings may experience significant price
        volatility such as sharp, unexpected declines or extended downturns due
        to broad market conditions or developments specific to an issuer,
        industry, or sector held by the Fund.

              Concentration Risk.</b
            >
            The Fund relies on a limited number of financial institutions that
            are authorized to purchase and redeem Creation Units directly with
            the Fund (each, an Authorized Participant or AP). There may also be
            a limited number of market makers and other liquidity providers
            active in Shares. If (i) APs exit the business, become unable to
            process creation and/or redemption orders, and no other APs step in,
            or (ii) market makers and/or other liquidity providers leave the
            market or materially scale back their activity and no replacements
            emerge, Shares may trade at a material discount to NAV and, in
            extreme cases, could face delisting.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <b>Costs of Buying or Selling Shares.</b> Investors who trade Shares
            in the secondary market will pay brokerage commissions or other
            charges set by their broker. Commissions are often fixed amounts and
            can be a significant proportional cost for investors transacting in
            small sizes. Secondary-market investors also bear the bid-ask
            spread. The spread varies over time with trading volume and market
            liquidity—generally narrower when trading volume and liquidity are
            higher and wider when they are lower. A relatively small investor
            base, sizable asset flows into or out of the Fund, and/or periods of
            elevated market volatility may widen spreads. Because commissions
            and spreads add to trading costs, frequent trading of Shares can
            materially reduce returns and may be inadvisable for investors who
            expect to make regular, small purchases or sales.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <b>Shares May Trade at Prices Other Than NAV.</b> As with all ETFs,
            Shares trade on an exchange at market prices that may differ from
            the Fund's NAV. At times, Shares may trade at an intraday premium
            (above NAV) or discount (below NAV) due to supply and demand for
            Shares or during volatile markets. This risk can be heightened in
            periods of market stress, sharp market declines, or when
            secondary-market trading activity in Shares is limited, in which
            case premiums or discounts may be significant.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <b>Trading.</b> Although Shares are listed for trading on [ ] (the
            "Exchange") and may trade on other U.S. exchanges, there is no
            assurance that Shares will trade with active volume, or trade at
            all, on any exchange. In stressed market conditions, the liquidity
            of Shares and the liquidity of the Fund's portfolio holdings may
            deteriorate.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <b>Financing and Cash Management Risk.</b> To pursue its 2x daily
        objective, the Fund expects to use derivatives that require the posting
        of margin or collateral and may maintain cash or cash equivalents for
        that purpose. The Fund's performance will be affected by the financing
        rates, spreads, and costs associated with its derivatives and any
        securities lending or cash management activities. These costs can reduce
        returns and may cause the Fund's results to deviate from 2x the daily
        performance of the Index.
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>General Market Risk.</b> Global economies and financial markets are
        increasingly interconnected, which raises the likelihood that events or
        conditions in one country or region will adversely affect markets or
        issuers elsewhere. Securities held by the Fund may underperform the
        broader markets, a particular market segment, or other asset classes due
        to factors that can include inflation (or expectations of inflation),
        interest-rate changes, shifts in global demand for products or
        resources, natural disasters or other major events, public-health
        emergencies, terrorism, regulatory developments, and governmental
        controls.
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>Leverage Risk.</b> By design, the Fund uses leverage to target 2x the
        daily performance of the Index. Leverage magnifies both gains and
        losses. As a result, small changes in the Index may produce larger
        changes in the Fund's NAV, and losses may be substantial. Leverage also
        increases the sensitivity of the Fund to financing costs, market
        volatility, and liquidity conditions. In adverse market conditions, the
        Fund may be required to reduce exposure rapidly or may be unable to
        maintain its targeted leverage.
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>Market Capitalization Risk.</b> Securities of large-capitalization
        companies may be relatively mature compared to smaller firms and
        therefore may exhibit slower growth during economic expansions.
        Large-capitalization companies may also be less agile in responding to
        new competitive challenges, including technological change and evolving
        consumer preferences.
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>Market Events Risk.</b> Financial markets can be volatile, and
        security prices can move substantially based on business cycles,
        interest-rate shifts, inflation or deflation views, perceived credit
        risk, and prevailing market liquidity, among other influences. In
        addition, the value of the Fund's investments may be negatively affected
        by the occurrence of global events. Global shocks, such as wars,
        terrorism, environmental or natural disasters, political instability,
        and epidemics or pandemics, as well as sanctions and trade restrictions
        (including those tied to recent conflicts in Eastern Europe and the
        Middle East) have increased market volatility and could continue to do
        so, affecting regional and global economies and certain securities.
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>New Fund Risk.</b> The Fund is newly organized and has limited or no
        operating history. As a result, prospective investors do not have a
        performance record on which to base their investment decisions. The Fund
        may require time to attract assets, develop secondary-market liquidity,
        and achieve efficient index tracking.
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>Non-Diversification Risk.</b> Because the Fund is "non-diversified,"
        it may invest a greater percentage of its assets in the securities of a
        single issuer or a smaller number of issuers than if it were
        diversified. Consequently, weakness in one issuer or in a small group of
        issuers can have a proportionately larger impact on the Fund's value.
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>Operational Risk.</b> The Fund is exposed to operational risks
        arising from people, processes, systems, and third parties. These risks
        include human mistakes; trade, settlement, or communication errors;
        failures or delays by service providers, counterparties, or other
        vendors; and breakdowns or outages in processes, technology, or other
        infrastructure. The Fund relies on external firms (e.g., custodian,
        transfer agent, administrator, pricing and data providers) for key
        functions, and difficulties engaging or retaining such providers, or
        disruptions in their services, could impair the Fund's operations and
        hinder achievement of its investment objective. The Fund and the Adviser
        maintain controls and procedures intended to manage operational risk,
        but no control environment can eliminate it entirely.
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>Passive Investment Risk.</b> The Fund is not actively managed and
        does not attempt to outperform its Index or take defensive positions in
        declining markets. As a result, the Fund's performance may be adversely
        affected by a general decline in the market segments relating to its
        Index. Because the Fund seeks to track its Index, its returns may lag
        other strategies or asset classes. Different categories of securities
        lead or lag at different times, sometimes for multi-year stretches, and
        the Fund will not take defensive positions to avoid such cycles.
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>Sector and Industry Risk.</b> If the Fund invests more heavily in
        particular sectors or industries, its results will be especially
        sensitive to events that significantly affect those areas. To the extent
        the Index becomes concentrated in one or more sectors or industries, the
        Fund will have similar exposure and could be negatively affected by
        adverse developments impacting those sectors or industries.
        <br />
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>Information Technology Sector Risk.</b> Companies in the
            information technology sector, and firms that rely heavily on
            technology, face fast product cycles, the risk of rapid
            obsolescence, evolving standards, and heightened regulation.
            Competition can be intense both domestically and internationally,
            including from lower-cost foreign competitors. Share prices of such
            companies, especially smaller or less-seasoned issuers, tend to be
            more volatile than the broader market. Many information technology
            companies depend on patents and other intellectual property; loss,
            impairment, or adverse enforcement of those rights (or allegations
            of infringement) could negatively affect their operating results and
            valuations. Supply-chain constraints, shortages of key inputs, and
            challenges attracting and retaining specialized talent may further
            pressure profitability.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <b>Third Party Data Risk.</b> The Index relies on information from
        third-party data vendors (e.g., prices, shares outstanding, free float,
        sector classifications, and corporate actions) and on calculations
        performed by an independent index calculator, Solactive AG (the "Index
        Calculator"). The Adviser (or an affiliate), as owner of the Index
        intellectual property, determines constituents and weights pursuant to
        the Index rules, including assessments of founder-led status based on
        public and other sources. Errors, delays, or misapplications by any
        party - data vendors, the Index Calculator, or the Adviser (or
        affiliate) - may result in unintended inclusions/exclusions, inaccurate
        weights, or delayed implementation of changes. Until corrected, such
        issues may cause the Fund to deviate from intended exposures and from
        the Index's published values. Solactive, as calculation agent, may use
        third-party data to calculate and maintain the Index, and certain data
        providers impose licensing and disclosure requirements. If required
        licenses are not in place or are revoked, or if a third-party data
        provider materially restricts use or significantly increases fees, Index
        calculation or dissemination may be interrupted or terminated on short
        notice.
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>Tracking Error Risk.</b> The Fund's results may differ from the Index
        because the Fund bears fees and trading costs the Index does not; at
        times the Fund may hold cash or positions not in the Index, or may not
        be fully invested in Index constituents.
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>Third-Party Data & Publication Risk.</b> The Index (and therefore the
        Fund) depends on third-party data and calculations. Neither the Fund's
        investment adviser nor the Index Calculator guarantees uninterrupted or
        timely index production or publication. The calculation and
        dissemination of Index values can be delayed or interrupted if the
        calculation agent, data vendors, or a relevant stock exchange
        experiences a malfunction or outage. Index values may be delayed by
        technology outages or other operational issues. If index publication is
        interrupted due to data or systems issues, trading in Shares could be
        disrupted or halted. Prolonged interruptions could lead to trading halts
        in Shares, which may have an adverse impact on the Fund and its
        shareholders.

        <b>MANAGEMENT</b>
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>Investment Adviser</b>
        <br />
        <br />
        Corgi Strategies, LLC (the "Adviser"), located at 473 Pine St, Floor 5,
        San Francisco, CA 94104, is a Delaware limited liability company seeking
        registration with the SEC as an investment adviser and serves as
        investment adviser to the Fund. The Adviser was founded in July 2025,
        and as of [ ], 2025, has no prior assets under management and has not
        served as the investment adviser or sub-adviser for any other registered
        funds.
        <br />
        <br />
        The Adviser is responsible for overall portfolio management and
        administration of the Fund pursuant to an investment advisory agreement
        with Corgi ETF Trust I (the "Trust") (the "Advisory Agreement"). In
        addition to executing portfolio transactions, the Adviser may arrange
        for, and oversee, service providers performing transfer agency, custody,
        fund administration/accounting, distribution, and other services
        necessary for the Fund's operations.
        <br />
        <br />
        Because the Fund seeks to deliver 2x the daily performance of the Index,
        the Adviser is responsible for daily rebalancing of the Fund's exposure
        to approximately two times the Index and for implementing the Fund's use
        of derivatives. The Fund expects to obtain leveraged exposure primarily
        through total return swaps on the Index, futures, and/or other
        derivatives. The Adviser oversees counterparty selection and monitoring,
        collateral and liquidity management, and the financing and transaction
        costs associated with such instruments. The Board has approved a
        derivatives risk management program and appointed a Derivatives Risk
        Manager who provides regular reports to the Board.
        <br />
        <br />
        For its services to the Fund, the Fund pays the Adviser a unitary
        management fee, calculated daily and paid monthly, at an annual rate of
        1.08% of the Fund's average daily net assets. Under the Advisory
        Agreement, the Adviser pays substantially all of the Fund's expenses
        except for: the advisory fee itself; interest charges on borrowings;
        taxes; brokerage commissions and other expenses related to buying and
        selling portfolio investments; dividends and other expenses on
        securities sold short; acquired fund fees and expenses; any accrued
        deferred tax liability; distribution fees and expenses under any Rule
        12b-1 plan; litigation and other extraordinary expenses; and any other
        expenses the Fund is responsible for under the Advisory Agreement
        (collectively, the "Excluded Expenses").
        <br /><br />
        For clarity, certain costs related to the Fund's use of derivatives (for
        example, financing charges reflected in swap payments, variation margin
        on futures, and other transaction-related costs) are not included in the
        Fund's Total Annual Fund Operating Expenses under the unitary fee. These
        amounts are embedded in the pricing and performance of the derivatives
        and therefore reduce the Fund's returns rather than appearing as
        operating expenses.
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>Advisory Agreement</b>
        <br />
        <br />
        A discussion of the basis for the Board's approval of the Advisory
        Agreement will appear in the Fund's Annual Report to shareholders for
        the period ended [ ], 2026, on Form N-CSR.
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>Portfolio Managers</b>
        <br />
        <br />
        The individual primarily responsible for the day-to-day management of
        the Fund is Brianna A. Lynch, Portfolio Manager, who has served in this
        role since 2025. In addition to general portfolio management, Ms. Lynch
        is responsible for the Fund's daily rebalancing and the implementation
        of derivatives positions designed to maintain exposure equal to
        approximately 2x the Index. Before her current role, Ms. Lynch served as
        a Senior Associate in Affiliates Investments and Investor Relations at
        Affiliated Managers Group (AMG) from June 2022 to August 2024; earlier,
        she was a Corporate Senior Associate at HarbourVest Partners from June
        2018 to June 2022, and worked in Transaction Support at EY from
        September 2016 to June 2018. Ms. Lynch received a Bachelor of Science in
        Business Management from Babson College in 2016 and completed Business
        Essentials training with the Corporate Finance Institute (CFI) in 2025.
        She is a member of the AICPA and holds the Certified Public Accountant
        (CPA) designation.

      <div align="LEFT">
        <b>HOW TO BUY AND SELL SHARES</b>
        <br />
        <br />
        The Fund issues and redeems Shares only in large blocks called "Creation
        Units," at the Fund's net asset value ("NAV") next determined after an
        order is accepted. Only authorized participants ("APs"), who must be
        members or participants of a registered clearing agency and must have an
        executed participant agreement with the Fund's distributor and transfer
        agent, may transact in Creation Units directly with the Fund. Once
        created, Shares may be bought and sold in the secondary market in
        amounts less than a Creation Unit.
        <br />
        <br />
        Because the Fund expects to achieve its 2x daily objective primarily
        through derivatives, the Fund generally expects to effect creations and
        redemptions in cash rather than in-kind. The Fund may impose transaction
        fees on cash creations and redemptions designed to cover the Fund's
        estimated costs, which may include the costs of entering into,
        maintaining, or unwinding derivatives.
        <br />
        <br />
        Most investors buy and sell Shares in secondary-market transactions
        through brokers. Shares are expected to be listed for trading on [ ]
        (the "Exchange") and can be bought and sold throughout the trading day
        at market prices. Investors may pay customary brokerage commissions and,
        because secondary-market transactions occur at market prices, investors
        may pay more than NAV when buying Shares and receive less than NAV when
        selling Shares.
      </div>

      <br />

      <div align="LEFT">
        <b>Book Entry</b>
        <br />
        <br />
        Shares are held only in book-entry form. The Depository Trust Company
        ("DTC") or its nominee is the record owner of all outstanding Shares.
        Beneficial ownership of Shares is shown on the records of DTC or its
        participants (e.g., brokers, banks, and other financial institutions).
        As a beneficial owner, you will not receive physical certificates and
        must rely on DTC and its participants to exercise rights associated with
        owning Shares, consistent with standard "street name" procedures.
      </div>

      <br />

      <div align="LEFT">
        <b>Frequent Purchases and Redemptions of Shares</b>
        <br />
        <br />
        The Fund does not impose restrictions on the frequency of purchases and
        redemptions of Shares. Purchases and redemptions by APs are integral to
        the ETF arbitrage mechanism and help keep market prices of Shares close
        to NAV. The Board has considered the potential for frequent purchases
        and redemptions, particularly for cash, to increase portfolio
        transaction costs, tracking difference, and realized capital gains, and
        has approved policies to mitigate these effects, including fair-value
        pricing and the imposition of transaction fees on Creation Unit
        purchases and redemptions designed to cover the Fund's costs. The Fund
        and the Adviser reserve the right to reject any purchase order at any
        time.
        <br />
      </div>

      <br />

      <div align="LEFT">
        <b>Determination of Net Asset Value</b>
        <br />
        <br />
        The Fund's NAV is calculated as of the close of regular trading on [ ]
        (normally 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time) on each day the Exchange is open for
        business. NAV is computed by dividing the Fund's net assets by the
        number of Shares outstanding.
        <br />
        <br />
        In determining NAV, portfolio securities and other assets are generally
        valued at market value using quotations, last sale prices, or values
        supplied by a pricing service or market makers. When such information is
        unavailable or is deemed unreliable, the affected investments are valued
        at fair value pursuant to the Fund's valuation procedures. Derivative
        instruments used to obtain leveraged exposure to the Index (such as
        swaps and futures) are valued pursuant to these procedures, which may
        reference exchange settlement prices, quotations from counterparties or
        independent pricing sources, or the values of related instruments (for
        example, an ETF designed to track the Index), particularly if the Index
        level is not computed as of the U.S. market close.
      </div>

      <br />

      <div align="LEFT">
        <b>Fair Value Pricing</b>
        <br />
        <br />
        The Board has designated the Adviser as the Fund's "valuation designee"
        under Rule 2a-5 of the 1940 Act, subject to the Board's oversight. The
        Adviser has adopted valuation policies and procedures to determine, in
        good faith, the fair value of investments for which market quotations
        are not readily available or are considered unreliable (for example,
        following a trading halt or when a primary pricing source fails to
        provide data). In making fair-value determinations, the Adviser may
        consider all reasonably available information deemed relevant, including
        issuer-specific data, market conditions, recent trading activity, and
        the circumstances that triggered the need for fair value. Because fair
        value determinations involve judgments, the prices assigned may differ
        from values realized upon sale.

        <b>DIVIDENDS, DISTRIBUTIONS, AND TAXES</b>
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>Dividends and Distributions</b>
        <br />
        <br />
        The Fund intends to pay dividends and interest income, if any, annually,
        and to distribute any net realized capital gains to shareholders at
        least annually. The Fund will declare and pay income and capital gain
        distributions, if any, in cash. Cash distributions may be reinvested in
        additional whole Shares only if the broker through whom you hold Shares
        offers that option. Your broker is responsible for delivering any income
        and capital gain distributions to you.
        <br />
        <br />
        Because the Fund expects to use derivatives to pursue its investment
        objective, distributions may include a higher proportion of ordinary
        income and short-term capital gains than funds that invest directly in
        equity securities. In some cases the Fund may recognize taxable income
        without receiving the associated cash at the same time (for example, on
        certain swaps or futures), which may require the Fund to sell
        investments, including derivatives, at times it would not otherwise do
        so in order to meet distribution requirements.
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>Taxes</b>
        <br />
        <br />
        The following discussion summarizes certain U.S. federal income tax
        considerations that generally apply to investments in the Fund. Your
        situation may differ. You should consult your tax adviser regarding the
        tax consequences of investing in Shares, including the application of
        foreign, state, and local tax laws.
        <br />
        <br />
        The Fund intends to qualify each year as a regulated investment company
        ("RIC") under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the
        "Code"). If the Fund satisfies minimum distribution requirements, a RIC
        is generally not subject to fund-level federal income tax on income and
        gains that are timely distributed to shareholders. If the Fund were to
        fail to qualify as a RIC or fail to meet the distribution requirements
        (and no relief were available), it could be subject to fund-level
        taxation, which would reduce income available for distribution.
        <br />
        <br />
        Unless your Shares are held through a tax-exempt entity or
        tax-advantaged account (such as an IRA), you should consider potential
        tax consequences when the Fund makes distributions, when you sell Shares
        on the Exchange, and (for institutional investors only) when you
        purchase or redeem Creation Units.
        <br />
        <br />
        This general discussion is based on the Code and applicable Treasury
        regulations in effect on the date of this Prospectus. New legislation,
        administrative guidance, or court decisions may materially change these
        conclusions and may apply retroactively.
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>Special tax considerations for derivatives and leveraged exposure</b>
        Investments in derivatives (including swaps, futures, and options) are
        subject to special and complex U.S. federal income tax rules that can,
        among other things, affect the timing, character, and amount of income,
        gains, or losses recognized by the Fund and, in turn, the character of
        amounts distributed to shareholders. For example, amounts from certain
        "Section 1256 contracts" (which can include regulated futures and
        certain options) are generally marked to market at year end and treated
        as 60% long-term and 40% short-term capital gain or loss, regardless of
        holding period. Periodic payments or accruals on swaps are generally
        treated as ordinary income or loss. The "straddle," "constructive sale,"
        and "wash sale" rules may defer losses or affect holding periods.
        Because these rules may be uncertain and could change, the Fund's use of
        derivatives could affect whether it has made sufficient distributions to
        maintain its qualification as a RIC and avoid fund-level tax. See the
        SAI for additional information, and consult your tax adviser regarding
        how these rules may affect you.
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>Taxes on Distributions</b>
        <br />
        <br />
        For federal income tax purposes, distributions of the Fund's net
        investment income are generally taxable to shareholders as ordinary
        income or as qualified dividend income. Tax treatment of distributions
        of net capital gains (if any) depends on how long the Fund held the
        investments that generated such gains, not on how long you have held
        your Shares. Sales of assets held by the Fund for more than one year
        generally produce long-term capital gains or losses; sales of assets
        held for one year or less generally produce short-term capital gains or
        losses. Distributions that the Fund reports as capital gain dividends
        ("Capital Gain Dividends") are taxable to shareholders as long-term
        capital gains. Distributions of short-term capital gains are generally
        taxable to shareholders as ordinary income. Dividends and distributions
        are generally taxable to you whether received in cash or reinvested in
        additional Shares.
        <br />
        <br />
        Distributions the Fund reports as "qualified dividend income" are
        generally taxed to non-corporate shareholders at the rates applicable to
        long-term capital gains, provided holding-period and other requirements
        are met. "Qualified dividend income" generally includes dividends from
        U.S. corporations and from certain qualified foreign corporations
        (including those incorporated in a U.S. possession, eligible for
        benefits under a comprehensive U.S. income tax treaty, or whose stock is
        readily tradable on an established U.S. market). Corporate shareholders
        may be eligible for a dividends-received deduction with respect to
        portions of dividends attributable to qualifying dividends the Fund
        receives from U.S. corporations, subject to applicable limitations.
        <br />
        <br />
        Shortly after the close of each calendar year, you will receive
        information describing the character of distributions you received from
        the Fund.
        <br />
        <br />
        In addition to federal income tax, certain individuals, trusts, and
        estates are subject to a 3.8% Net Investment Income ("NII") tax. This
        tax is imposed on the lesser of: (i) net investment income (as reduced
        by properly allocable deductions) or (ii) the excess of modified
        adjusted gross income over specified thresholds ($250,000 for married
        filing jointly, $200,000 for single filers, and $125,000 for married
        filing separately). The Fund's distributions and any capital gains
        realized on a sale or redemption of Shares are generally included in net
        investment income for purposes of the NII tax.
        <br />
        <br />
        In general, distributions are taxable to you in the year paid. However,
        certain distributions paid in January may be treated as paid on December
        31 of the year prior. In general, distributions are taxable even if they
        are paid from income or gains earned by the Fund before you purchased
        Shares (and thus were reflected in the Shares' NAV at the time of
        purchase).
        <br />
        <br />
        You may want to avoid purchasing Shares immediately before a dividend or
        other distribution, since the distribution will generally be taxable to
        you even if, in economic terms, it represents a return of part of your
        investment.
        <br />
        <br />
        If you are neither a U.S. citizen nor a U.S. resident (or are a foreign
        entity), distributions (other than Capital Gain Dividends) will
        generally be subject to U.S. withholding tax at a 30% rate, unless a
        lower treaty rate applies. Under certain circumstances, the Fund may
        report all or a portion of a dividend as an "interest-related dividend"
        or a "short-term capital gain dividend," which would generally be exempt
        from this 30% withholding tax, provided other requirements are met.
        <br />
        <br />
        The Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act ("FATCA") may require the Fund to
        withhold a 30% tax (generally not refundable) from distributions of net
        investment income made to: (A) certain foreign financial institutions
        that do not satisfy applicable FATCA reporting or due-diligence
        requirements (or that are not treated as compliant under an applicable
        intergovernmental agreement), and (B) certain non-financial foreign
        entities that do not provide required information regarding substantial
        U.S. owners. FATCA may also affect the Fund's returns on foreign
        investments or a shareholder's returns if Shares are held through a
        foreign intermediary. Consult your tax adviser regarding FATCA's
        application and any related certification, compliance, reporting, and
        withholding obligations.
        <br />
        <br />
        The Fund (or a financial intermediary, such as a broker, through which a
        shareholder holds Shares) is generally required to withhold and remit to
        the U.S. Treasury a portion of taxable distributions and sale or
        redemption proceeds if the shareholder fails to furnish a correct
        taxpayer identification number, has underreported certain interest or
        dividend income, or fails to certify that they are not subject to such
        withholding.
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>Taxes When Shares are Sold on the Exchange</b>
        <br />
        <br />
        Any capital gain or loss realized upon a sale of Shares generally is
        treated as long-term capital gain or loss if Shares have been held for
        more than one year, and as short-term capital gain or loss if Shares
        have been held for one year or less. However, a capital loss on Shares
        held six months or less is treated as long-term to the extent of Capital
        Gain Dividends received with respect to such Shares. Losses are
        disallowed to the extent you acquire (including through dividend
        reinvestment) substantially identical Shares within a 61-day period
        beginning 30 days before and ending 30 days after the sale.
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>Taxes on Purchases and Redemptions of Creation Units</b>
        <br />
        <br />
        An authorized participant ("AP") whose functional currency is the U.S.
        dollar and who exchanges securities for Creation Units generally
        recognizes gain or loss equal to the difference between (i) the value of
        the Creation Units at the time of the exchange and (ii) the AP's
        aggregate basis in the securities delivered plus any cash paid. An AP
        that exchanges Creation Units for securities will generally recognize
        gain or loss equal to the difference between (i) the AP's basis in the
        Creation Units and (ii) the aggregate U.S. dollar market value of the
        securities received plus any cash received. The IRS may assert that a
        loss realized upon an exchange of securities for Creation Units is not
        currently deductible (e.g., under the "wash sale" rules for an AP not
        marking to market, or on the theory that there was no significant change
        in economic position). APs should consult their own tax advisers about
        the application of wash sale rules and the timing of any loss
        deductions.
        <br />
        <br />
        Any capital gain or loss realized upon redemption of Creation Units is
        generally treated as long-term capital gain or loss if the Shares
        comprising the Creation Units were held for more than one year, and as
        short-term capital gain or loss if held for one year or less.
        <br />
        <br />
        The Fund may include a payment of cash in addition to, or in place of,
        delivering a basket of securities when redeeming Creation Units. To
        raise cash for such redemptions, the Fund may sell portfolio securities,
        potentially recognizing investment income and/or capital gains or losses
        it might not have recognized if the redemption had been satisfied
        entirely in kind. As a result, including cash in redemption proceeds can
        reduce the Fund's tax efficiency.
        <br />
        <br />
        The foregoing discussion summarizes some possible consequences under
        current federal tax law of investing in the Fund. It is not a substitute
        for personal tax advice. You may also be subject to foreign, state, and
        local taxes on Fund distributions and on sales of Shares. Consult your
        tax adviser regarding the tax consequences of investing in Shares under
        all applicable laws. For additional information, see "Federal Income
        Taxes" in the SAI.

        The Agreement and Declaration of Trust (the "Declaration of Trust") sets
        forth a detailed process for shareholders to bring derivative or direct
        actions, designed to permit legitimate claims while limiting the costs,
        distraction, and other harm that can result from spurious demands and
        derivative actions. Before bringing a derivative action, a demand by
        three unrelated shareholders must be made to the Fund's Trustees. The
        Declaration of Trust specifies required information, certifications,
        undertakings, and acknowledgments that must accompany such a demand.
        Upon receiving a demand, the Trustees have 90 days—extendable by an
        additional 60 days—to consider it. If a majority of the Trustees who are
        independent for purposes of considering the demand determine that
        pursuing the requested action is not in the best interests of the Fund,
        they must reject the demand, and the complaining shareholders may not
        proceed with a derivative action unless they can demonstrate to a court
        that the Trustees' decision was not a good-faith exercise of business
        judgment on the Fund's behalf. In addition, shareholders owning Shares
        representing no less than a majority of the Fund's outstanding shares
        must join in bringing any derivative action. If a demand is rejected,
        the complaining shareholders may be responsible for the Fund's costs and
        expenses (including attorneys' fees) incurred in considering the demand
        if a court determines that the demand was made without reasonable cause
        or for an improper purpose. If a derivative action is brought in
        violation of the Declaration of Trust, the shareholders bringing the
        action may be responsible for the Fund's costs, including attorneys'
        fees, if a court determines that the action was brought without
        reasonable cause or for an improper purpose. The Declaration of Trust
        provides that no shareholder may bring a direct action alleging injury
        as a shareholder of the Trust or any Fund where the matters alleged
        would, if true, give rise to a claim belonging to the Trust (or the
        Trust on behalf of the Fund), unless the shareholder has suffered a harm
        distinct from that of other shareholders. A shareholder bringing a
        direct claim must be a shareholder of the Fund at the time of the
        alleged injury or must have acquired the shares by operation of law from
        a person who was also a shareholder as of that time. The Declaration of
        Trust further provides that the Fund will pay attorneys' fees and legal
        expenses incurred by a complaining shareholder only if required by law,
        and any attorneys' fees the Fund is obligated to pay will be calculated
        using reasonable hourly rates. These provisions do not apply to claims
        brought under the federal securities laws.
        <br />
        <br />
        The Declaration of Trust provides that shareholder actions against the
        Fund must be filed exclusively in state or federal courts located in
        Delaware. This forum provision does not apply to claims under the
        federal securities laws. Limiting actions to courts in Delaware may
        impose economic hardship on shareholders (e.g., travel costs, the need
        to retain local counsel) and may limit access to a forum some
        shareholders would otherwise prefer, which could discourage such
        actions.

        <h3>GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT THE TRUST</h3>
        <br />
        The Trust is an open-end management investment company with multiple
        series, including the Founder-Led ETF and the Founder-Led 2x Daily ETF
        (each, a "Fund"). This SAI relates to the Funds. The Trust is a Delaware
        statutory trust formed on: July 15, 2025. The Trust is registered with
        the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") under the Investment
        Company Act of 1940, as amended (together with the rules and regulations
        thereunder, the "1940 Act"), as an open-end management investment
        company, and the offering of shares of beneficial interest ("Shares") is
        registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities
        Act").The Trust is governed by its Board of Trustees (the "Board"). The
        Founder-Led ETF seeks to track the performance, before fees and
        expenses, of the Founder-Led Index (the "Index"). The Founder-Led 2x
        Daily ETF seeks daily investment results, before fees and expenses, that
        correspond to 2x the Index's daily performance. Corgi Strategies, LLC
        (the "Adviser") and will serve upon effectiveness of its SEC
        registration as investment adviser to the Funds.
        <br />
        <br />
        For the Founder-Led 2x Daily ETF, the Fund seeks daily investment
        results, before fees and expenses, that correspond to 2x the daily
        performance of the Index. The Fund resets its exposure each trading day
        to target approximately two times the Index's daily move and should not
        be expected to provide 2x the return of the Index for periods longer
        than a single day. Because of daily compounding, Index volatility,
        financing costs, and expenses, the Fund's results over periods longer
        than a day will usually differ in amount, and may differ in direction,
        from 2x the Index's multi-day return. The Fund expects to obtain
        leveraged exposure primarily through derivatives (for example, total
        return swaps and futures) and to rebalance exposure daily. It is
        possible to lose the full value of an investment in the Fund in a single
        day.
        <br />
        <br />
        Each Fund offers and issues Shares at their net asset value ("NAV") only
        in aggregations of a specified number of Shares (each, a "Creation
        Unit"). A Fund generally issues and redeems Creation Units in exchange
        for a basket of securities ("Deposit Securities") together with a
        specified cash payment (the "Cash Component"). The Trust may permit or
        require the substitution of a cash amount ("Deposit Cash") in lieu of
        some or all Deposit Securities. Shares are expected to be listed on [ ]
        (the "Exchange") and trade on the Exchange at market prices, which may
        differ from NAV. Shares are redeemable only in Creation Unit
        aggregations and, in general, in exchange for portfolio securities and a
        specified cash payment, or instead, entirely for cash. As a practical
        matter, mostly only institutions or large investors, known as
        "Authorized Participants" or "APs," purchase or redeem Creation Units.
        Except when aggregated in Creation Units, Shares are not individually
        redeemable.
        <br />
        <br />
        Because the Founder-Led 2x Daily ETF expects to achieve its objective
        primarily through derivatives, the Trust generally anticipates effecting
        creations and redemptions for that Fund in cash rather than in-kind. The
        Trust may impose transaction fees on cash creations and redemptions
        designed to cover the Fund's estimated costs, which may include costs of
        entering into, maintaining, or unwinding derivatives positions and
        related financing and hedging costs.
        <br />
        <br />
        Shares may be issued in advance of receipt of some or all Deposit
        Securities, subject to conditions set forth in the participant agreement
        among the AP, the distributor, and the transfer agent (the "Participant
        Agreement"), including a requirement to maintain with the Trust cash at
        least equal to a specified percentage of the value of any missing
        Deposit Securities. The Trust may impose a transaction fee on each
        creation or redemption. In all cases, such fees will be limited in
        accordance with SEC requirements applicable to management investment
        companies offering redeemable securities. As with other publicly traded
        securities, brokers' commissions on secondary-market transactions are
        negotiated with your broker at customary rates.
        <br />
        <br />
        Use of derivatives by the Founder-Led 2x Daily ETF is subject to Rule
        18f-4 under the 1940 Act. The Trust has adopted a derivatives risk
        management program, appointed a Derivatives Risk Manager approved by the
        Board, and manages the Fund's derivatives exposure using value-at-risk
        (VaR) testing. Under Rule 18f-4, the Fund's VaR must not exceed 200% of
        the VaR of a designated reference portfolio (generally the Index) under
        the relative VaR test or, if a reference portfolio is not appropriate,
        20% of the Fund's net assets under the absolute VaR test. The Fund
        intends to use the Index as its designated reference portfolio for the
        relative VaR test under Rule 18f-4 and monitor compliance accordingly.
        The Derivatives Risk Manager provides regular reports to the Board
        regarding the program's implementation and the Fund's compliance.

        result, a Fund is not limited by the 1940 Act with respect to the
        percentage of its assets that may be invested in the securities of a
        single issuer. A Fund therefore may invest a larger portion of its
        assets in the securities of a single issuer or a smaller number of
        issuers than a diversified fund. Those issuers may represent a greater
        portion of the Fund's portfolio, which can adversely affect performance
        or subject Shares to greater price volatility than more diversified
        investment companies. While each Fund is "non-diversified" under the
        1940 Act, to qualify as a RIC the Fund must satisfy Subchapter M
        diversification tests. Accordingly, with respect to at least 50% of
        total assets, the Fund will not hold more than 10% of the outstanding
        voting securities of any one issuer or invest more than 5% of total
        assets in any one issuer.
        <br />
        <br />
        Although each Fund is non-diversified for purposes of the 1940 Act, each
        intends to maintain the diversification required under the Code and
        otherwise operate so as to qualify as a regulated investment company
        ("RIC") for federal income tax purposes, thereby generally avoiding
        fund-level federal income tax on income and gains distributed to
        shareholders. Compliance with the Code's diversification and other
        requirements may limit investment flexibility and could make it less
        likely that a Fund will meet its investment objective. See "Federal
        Income Taxes" in this SAI for further discussion.

          <b>Special Considerations for the Founder-Led 2x Daily ETF</b>
          <br />
          <ul>
            <li>
              <b>Daily Objective and Compounding.</b> The Fund seeks 2x the
              Index's daily performance and resets exposure each trading day.
              Over periods longer than a day, the Fund's results reflect the
              compounding of daily returns and the path of daily Index moves and
              will usually differ from 2x the Index's return for the same
              period.
            </li>
            <br /><br />
            <li>
              <b>Volatility Effect.</b> Generally, higher day-to-day volatility
              in the Index increases the divergence between the Fund's multi-day
              results and 2x the Index's multi-day return. In trending,
              lower-volatility markets, multi-day results may be closer to or
              greater than 2x; in choppy or range-bound markets, they are often
              less than 2x.
            </li>
            <br /><br />
            <li>
              <b>Correlation and Rebalancing.</b> The Fund may not achieve
              perfect correlation to 2x the Index's daily performance for
              reasons that include derivative pricing and liquidity, intraday
              Index movements (including near the close), timing and size of
              rebalancing, market closures or trading halts, financing costs,
              and Fund expenses.
            </li>
            <br /><br />
            <li>
              <b>Financing and Cash Management.</b> The Fund's use of swaps,
              futures, and other instruments involves financing or implied
              financing charges that reduce returns. The Fund may hold cash and
              cash equivalents (for example, U.S. Treasury bills, money market
              instruments, or repurchase agreements) for margin and collateral,
              which can affect exposure and results.
            </li>
            <br /><br />
            <li>
              <b>Counterparty and Clearinghouse Exposure.</b> The Fund is
              exposed to the credit of derivatives counterparties, futures
              commission merchants, and clearinghouses. Defaults or operational
              disruptions could cause losses, delays in recovery of collateral
              or margin, or both.
            </li>
            <br /><br />
            <li>
              <b>Use of ETF-Linked Swaps.</b> To the extent the Fund uses swaps
              referencing an ETF that seeks to track the Index (or a similar
              index), tracking differences between the ETF and the Index can add
              an additional source of correlation error.
            </li>
            <br /><br />
            <li>
              <b>Not a Buy-and-Hold Substitute.</b> The Fund is intended for
              knowledgeable investors who intend to monitor positions
              frequently. It is possible to lose the entire investment in a
              single day.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>General Risks</b>
        <br />
        <br />
        The value of a Fund's portfolio securities may fluctuate with changes in
        an issuer's or counterparty's financial condition, with issuer-specific
        or industry-specific developments, and with broader economic or
        political conditions. An investor in a Fund could lose money over short
        or long periods.
        <br />
        <br />
        There is no assurance that a liquid market will exist for all securities
        held by a Fund. Market liquidity may depend on whether dealers are
        willing to make markets in particular securities. There can be no
        assurance that a market will be made or maintained, or that any such
        market will remain liquid. The price at which securities may be sold,
        and the value of Shares, can be adversely affected if trading markets
        for a Fund's portfolio securities are limited or absent, or if bid/ask
        spreads are wide.
        <br />
        <br />
        Financial markets, domestic and foreign, have at times experienced
        unusually high volatility. Continuing events and market turbulence may
        adversely affect Fund performance.
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>Cyber Security Risk.</b> Investment companies and their service
        providers face operational and information-security risks from cyber
        incidents. Cyber events include, among other things, data theft or
        corruption, denial-of-service attacks, unauthorized release of
        confidential information, and other breaches. Cyber incidents affecting
        a Fund or the Adviser, custodian, transfer agent, intermediaries, or
        other third-party service providers may, among other effects, disrupt
        the processing of shareholder transactions, impair a Fund's ability to
        calculate its NAV, cause the release of private shareholder or issuer
        information, impede trading, result in regulatory fines or financial
        losses, and damage reputation. A Fund may also incur additional costs
        for cybersecurity risk management. Similar risks affect issuers in which
        a Fund invests and could have material adverse consequences for such
        issuers, potentially reducing the value of the Fund's investments.
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>Index Tracking Risks.</b> A Fund's return may not match the return of
        the Index for many reasons. For example, a Fund bears operating expenses
        (including taxes) not applicable to the Index and incurs costs
        associated with buying and selling securities, particularly when
        rebalancing its holdings to reflect changes to the Index, or when
        raising cash to meet redemptions or deploying cash from inflows.
        Transaction costs, including brokerage, can reduce a Fund's NAV.
        <br />
        <br />
        Market disruptions or regulatory restrictions may impair a Fund's
        ability to adjust exposures to the levels required to track the Index.
        Unusual market conditions may cause the Index Calculator to postpone a
        scheduled rebalance, which can cause the Index to deviate from its
        typical composition. There is no assurance that the Index Calculator or
        any of its agents will compile or calculate the Index accurately. Errors
        in the quality, accuracy, or completeness of data used to compile the
        Index may occur and may not be identified and corrected promptly,
        particularly for less widely used benchmarks. Gains, losses, or costs
        associated with Index or data errors are generally borne by a Fund and
        its shareholders. For example, during any period when the Index contains
        an incorrect constituent, the Fund would have exposure to that
        constituent and be underexposed to other Index constituents. Such errors
        may positively or negatively affect a Fund and its shareholders.
        <br />
        <br />
        If the Index is rebalanced on an ad hoc basis and a Fund rebalances to
        increase correlation, any resulting transaction costs and interim market
        exposures are borne by the Fund and its shareholders. A Fund may not be
        fully invested at times due to cash flows, or because it maintains cash
        reserves to meet expenses or redemptions. In addition, a Fund may not
        invest in certain securities or other assets included in the Index, or
        may hold them in different proportions than in the Index. A Fund's
        performance may also deviate from the Index due to exchange listing
        standards, a lack of liquidity in markets where Index securities trade,
        tax considerations or other regulatory reasons (such as diversification
        requirements). Liquidity shortfalls may arise from market events,
        economic conditions, or investor sentiment. Illiquid securities may be
        difficult to value and may be valued below comparable liquid securities,
        which can negatively affect performance. A Fund may also be delayed in
        purchasing or selling Index constituents. In volatile markets, the
        ability to sell securities at prices reflecting fair value may be
        impaired, potentially increasing trading costs and index tracking risk.
        A Fund may need to borrow to meet redemptions, which could increase
        expenses. For tax-efficiency, a Fund may sell certain securities in ways
        that realize losses, which can cause performance to deviate from the
        Index. Performance may also deviate due to the impact of withholding
        taxes, late announcements of Index changes, and high Index turnover.
        <br />
        <br />
        A Fund may fair value certain investments. To the extent a Fund
        calculates NAV based on fair-valued prices that differ from prices used
        in Index calculations, the Fund's ability to track the Index may be
        adversely affected. The need to comply with the Code's diversification
        and other requirements may also affect tracking. Actions taken in
        response to proposed corporate actions can increase tracking error. In
        light of the foregoing, a Fund's return may deviate significantly from
        the Index's return.
        <br />
        <br />
        Apart from scheduled rebalances, the Index Owner and Index Calculator or
        its agents may implement additional, ad hoc rebalances (for example, to
        correct an error in constituent selection). When the Index is rebalanced
        and a Fund rebalances to increase correlation, any resulting transaction
        costs and interim market exposures are borne by the Fund and its
        shareholders. Errors and ad hoc rebalances may therefore increase costs
        and tracking error risk.
        <br />
        <br />
        Index tracking risk may be heightened during periods of increased market
        volatility or other unusual market conditions. Changes to the Index's
        composition in connection with a rebalance or reconstitution may cause a
        Fund to experience increased volatility, during which time the Fund's
        index tracking risk may be elevated.

        <h3>DESCRIPTION OF PERMITTED INVESTMENTS</h3>
        <br />
        The following describes the investments and techniques the Fund may use,
        and the related risks. The Fund will employ any investment or practice
        below only if it is consistent with the Fund's investment objective and
        permitted by the Fund's stated policies. Some items discussed in this
        SAI are not principal strategies, as disclosed in the Prospectus; while
        the Fund is permitted to use them, it is not required to do so.
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>Borrowing</b>
        <br />
        <br />
        Although the Fund does not expect to borrow, it may do so to the extent
        allowed by the 1940 Act. Under the 1940 Act, the Fund may borrow up to
        one-third (1/3) of its total assets. Any borrowing would be for
        short-term or emergency purposes, not for investment, and would be
        repaid promptly. Borrowing magnifies the effect on NAV of changes in the
        market value of the Fund's holdings. Amounts borrowed bear interest
        (which may or may not be offset by earnings on purchased securities),
        and maintaining a credit facility may involve minimum balances,
        commitment fees, or other costs that increase the effective cost of
        borrowing.
        <br />
        <br />
        For the Founder-Led 2x Daily ETF, leverage is expected to come primarily
        from derivatives (for example, total return swaps and futures) rather
        than from cash borrowings. If the Fund borrows, the Fund will maintain
        asset coverage of at least 300% of all borrowings as required by Section
        18 of the 1940 Act. Short-term borrowings, if any, may include custodial
        overdrafts or borrowings under a credit facility for settlement,
        liquidity, or other administrative purposes, and will be repaid
        promptly.
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>Equity Securities</b>
        <br />
        <br />
        Equity securities (for example, common stock) are subject to
        stock-market risk and may fluctuate significantly as market conditions,
        investor sentiment, or an issuer's financial position change. Declines
        in the value of equity holdings may cause the Fund's Shares to fall in
        value.
        <br />
        <br />
        An investment in the Fund entails the risks inherent in equity
        ownership, including the risk that issuer fundamentals deteriorate or
        that broad market conditions weaken, either of which can reduce the
        value of portfolio securities and, in turn, the value of Shares. Equity
        prices can be volatile as investor expectations shift with respect to
        government, economic, monetary, and fiscal policies; inflation and
        interest rates; business cycles; and global or regional political,
        economic, or banking stresses. With respect to the Founder-Led 2x Daily
        ETF, equity exposure is typically obtained indirectly through
        derivatives that reference the Index rather than through direct
        holdings.
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>Types of Equity Securities:</b>
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>Common Stocks -</b> Common stock represents an ownership interest in
        an issuer, typically with voting rights and the potential to receive
        dividends. Unlike preferred stock, dividends on common stock are not
        fixed and are declared at the discretion of the issuer's board of
        directors.
        <br />
        <br />
        Holders of common stock generally take on more risk than holders of
        preferred stock or debt because common shareholders stand behind
        creditors and preferred shareholders in the issuer's capital structure.
        Common stock has neither a stated principal amount nor a maturity date
        and remains subject to market fluctuations as long as it is outstanding.
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>Preferred Stocks -</b> Preferred stock represents an ownership
        interest that typically has priority over common stock for dividends and
        liquidation proceeds, but is junior to the issuer's liabilities.
        Preferred stock generally has no voting rights. Varieties include
        adjustable-rate, fixed-dividend, perpetual, and sinking-fund preferred
        stock.
        <br />
        <br />
        In general, market values of fixed-rate, non-convertible preferred stock
        move inversely with interest rates and with changes in perceived credit
        quality.
        <br />
        <br />
        <div align="LEFT">
          <b>Derivatives Used by the Founder-Led 2x Daily ETF</b>
          <br />
          The Founder-Led 2x Daily ETF seeks daily investment results, before
          fees and expenses, that correspond to 2x of the daily performance of
          the Index. To pursue this objective, the Fund expects to obtain
          leveraged exposure primarily through the derivatives set out below and
          to rebalance its exposure on each Business Day. Daily rebalancing and
          compounding can cause the Fund's return for periods longer than one
          day to differ, and potentially differ significantly, from 2x the
          return of the Index for the same period. Market volatility, holding
          period, and the path of returns will affect the degree of such
          divergence.

          <ul>
            <li>
              <b>Swap Agreements.</b> The Fund may enter into total return swaps
              and other swap contracts that reference the Index or an
              exchange-traded fund designed to track the Index (or a similar
              index). Swaps typically require the Fund to exchange periodic
              payments based on the performance of the reference asset for
              financing and/or fee payments. Swaps may be traded bilaterally
              (subject to counterparty credit risk and collateral arrangements)
              or, in some cases, cleared through a central clearinghouse
              (introducing clearinghouse and futures commission merchant risk).
              Total return swaps are expected to be a primary tool for obtaining
              leveraged exposure. Under normal market conditions, the Fund
              expects the aggregate notional amount of its swap positions,
              together with other derivatives, to be approximately 200% of the
              Fund's net assets, before taking into account any cash or cash
              equivalents held for margin and collateral. Swaps are typically
              documented under an ISDA Master Agreement with a credit support
              annex that requires posting and collection of variation margin
              (and, where applicable, initial margin). Swap exposures may be
              reset or rebalanced daily to help the Fund maintain its target
              exposure.
            </li>
            <br /><br />
            <li>
              <b>Futures Contracts.</b> The Fund may use exchange-traded futures
              on broad equity indexes or on exchange-traded funds designed to
              track such indexes to obtain or adjust exposure. Futures require
              initial and variation margin and are marked to market daily.
              Futures may reference broad equity indexes or exchange-traded
              funds that seek to track such indexes, including contracts traded
              on U.S. exchanges. Positions are subject to exchange and
              clearinghouse margin requirements and may be subject to exchange
              or regulatory position limits. The Fund may increase or reduce
              futures exposure intraday or at the close in connection with its
              daily rebalance.
            </li>
            <br /><br />
            <li>
              <b>Options.</b> The Fund may use options on futures, indexes, or
              exchange-traded funds for exposure or to manage risk. Option
              values can be highly sensitive to changes in the price and
              volatility of the reference asset and to time decay. The Fund
              expects to use options opportunistically for exposure or risk
              management and does not expect options to be a primary source of
              the Fund's leverage.
            </li>
            <br /><br />
            <li>
              <b>Money Market Instruments and Short-Term Investments.</b> The
              Fund may hold cash, U.S. government securities, repurchase
              agreements, and interests in money market funds to meet margin and
              collateral needs, to manage liquidity, or pending investment. To
              the extent the Fund invests in a money market fund, shareholders
              bear their proportionate share of the money market fund's fees in
              addition to the Fund's expenses. Cash and cash equivalents may
              serve as collateral for the Fund's derivatives and to meet margin
              calls. Holding cash or cash equivalents may reduce the Fund's
              ability to maintain its target level of leveraged exposure and may
              contribute to tracking differences.

              <b>Securities Lending.</b> See Securities Lending below for a
              fuller discussion. If the Fund engages in lending, it will do so
              pursuant to Board-approved guidelines; lending involves
              counterparty, collateral investment, and operational risks.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Daily Rebalancing and Compounding.</b> To seek 2x of the
              Index's daily return, the Fund will generally rebalance its
              derivatives exposure each Business Day. Because of compounding,
              the Fund's return over periods longer than one day is likely to
              differ from 2x the return of the Index for the same period. The
              degree of divergence can be positive or negative and depends on
              factors including volatility, fees and expenses, and the timing
              and magnitude of index moves.

            <li>
              <b>Derivatives Risk Management and Rule 18f-4.</b> The Fund
              expects to rely on Rule 18f-4 under the 1940 Act for its
              derivatives and certain financing transactions. Among other
              things, the Fund will operate a derivatives risk management
              program administered by a designated derivatives risk manager, and
              the Fund will be subject to a value-at-risk (VaR) limit.
              Generally, the Fund will satisfy the limit if the VaR of its
              portfolio (including derivatives) does not exceed 200% of the VaR
              of a designated reference portfolio (the Relative VaR test) or, if
              that test is not appropriate, 20% of the Fund's net assets (the
              Absolute VaR test).

            <br /><br />
            <li>
              <b>Commodity Interests and CFTC Matters.</b> To the extent the
              Fund invests in commodity interests (for example, futures, options
              on futures, or swaps), the Adviser intends to claim an exclusion
              from the definition of "commodity pool operator" with respect to
              the Fund, such that the Adviser would not be required to register
              with the CFTC as a commodity pool operator for the Fund.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>Rights and Warrants -</b> Rights give existing shareholders the
        privilege to subscribe to a new issue of common stock, usually for a
        short period (often two to four weeks) at a discount to the public
        offering price; rights are typically transferable. Warrants are
        long-dated options, often issued with debt or preferred stock, that
        allow the holder to purchase common shares at a specified price;
        warrants are usually transferable and may trade on exchanges.
        <br />
        <br />
        Rights and warrants may involve greater risk than direct investment in
        the underlying securities. They typically do not convey voting rights,
        dividends, or ownership in the issuer's assets; their values may not
        track the underlying securities; and they can expire worthless if not
        exercised by their expiration dates. Using rights or warrants can
        increase potential gains and losses compared to investing the same
        amount directly in the underlying stock.
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>When-Issued Securities -</b> A when-issued security has defined terms
        and an active market but has not yet been issued. In such transactions
        the Fund relies on the counterparty to deliver. If delivery does not
        occur, the Fund may miss an opportunity to acquire the security at an
        attractive price or yield.
        <br />
        <br />
        Purchasing when-issued securities exposes the Fund to ownership-like
        risks prior to settlement, including price and yield changes. By
        settlement, the market value may be higher or lower than the agreed
        purchase price, and prevailing yields may differ from those available
        when the trade was executed. Because payment is deferred until delivery,
        these risks are in addition to the risks of the Fund's other
        investments.
        <br />
        <br />
        SEC Rule 18f-4 under the 1940 Act (the "Derivatives Rule") permits
        investments on a when-issued, forward-settling, or non-standard
        settlement basis notwithstanding Section 18's senior-security
        restrictions, provided the Fund intends to physically settle and
        settlement will occur within 35 days of the trade date (the
        "Delayed-Settlement Securities" provision). Transactions that do not
        meet that provision are treated as derivatives under Rule 18f-4.
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>Short Sales</b>
        <br />
        <br />
        The Fund may engage in short sales of securities it does not own (and,
        in some cases, short sales against-the-box). In a short sale, the Fund
        borrows the security, sells it, and later seeks to purchase the same
        security to return to the lender. Short sales involve the risk that the
        borrowed security increases in price before the position is closed,
        which would result in a loss. The Fund can also be required to close a
        short position earlier than desired (for example, if the lender recalls
        the security or borrowing costs rise), which may cause a loss.
        <br />
        <br />
        Short sales require the Fund to pledge liquid assets and to post margin
        with the broker. While the short position is open, the Fund generally
        will pay borrowing fees and any amounts equal to dividends or interest
        that accrue on the borrowed security. These amounts reduce the return on
        the position and can create a negative cost of carry. Any payments in
        lieu of dividends on short positions generally are not qualified
        dividend income.
        <br />
        <br />
        For purposes of Rule 18f-4 under the 1940 Act, short sales are treated
        as derivatives transactions and are subject to the Fund's derivatives
        risk management program and value-at-risk limits. Short sales also
        involve counterparty, liquidity, and operational risks, including the
        risk of buy-in if the broker cannot continue to borrow the security.
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>Illiquid Investments and Restricted Securities</b>
        <br />
        <br />
        Under Rule 22e-4, the Fund may not acquire any illiquid investment if,
        immediately after purchase, more than 15% of its net assets would be
        invested in illiquid investments that are assets. An "illiquid
        investment" is one the Fund reasonably expects it cannot sell or dispose
        of, under current market conditions, within seven calendar days without
        materially affecting the investment's market value. The Fund maintains a
        liquidity risk management program and procedures to identify illiquid
        investments pursuant to Rule 22e-4. The 15% limit is observed on an
        ongoing basis. If the Fund's holdings of illiquid investments exceed 15%
        of net assets because of market activity, liquidity changes, or other
        factors, the Fund will report the occurrence to the Board and will make
        determinations and take steps, consistent with Rule 22e-4 and
        Board-approved procedures, to reduce illiquid investments to or below
        15% of net assets within a reasonable period.
        <br />
        <br />
        The Fund may purchase restricted securities that may be resold to
        institutional investors and that, under the Fund's liquidity program,
        may be determined not to be illiquid. Many such securities trade in the
        institutional market under Rule 144A of the Securities Act and are
        referred to as Rule 144A securities.
        <br />
        <br />
        Illiquid investments generally involve more risk than comparable,
        readily marketable securities. They may trade at a discount, may be
        harder to sell at a fair price or in a timely manner, and may prevent
        the Fund from taking advantage of market opportunities. Risks are most
        acute when the Fund needs cash (for example, during periods of net
        redemptions), potentially necessitating borrowing or sales at
        unfavorable prices.
        <br />
        <br />
        Illiquid investments are often privately placed and may not be listed or
        traded on established markets. They may not be freely transferable under
        applicable law or due to contractual resale restrictions. If privately
        placed securities can only be sold through private negotiations, the
        realized price may be below the Fund's purchase price or below fair
        value. Issuers that are not public may be subject to less stringent
        disclosure and investor-protection requirements. If registration is
        required before resale, the Fund may bear those costs. Private
        placements may involve smaller, less seasoned issuers with limited
        product lines, markets, financial resources, or management depth, and
        the Fund may receive material non-public information that can restrict
        trading.
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>Investment Company Securities</b>
        <br />
        <br />
        The Fund may invest in other investment companies, including money
        market funds and ETFs, subject to Section 12(d)(1) of the 1940 Act and
        related rules. Investing through another pooled vehicle exposes the Fund
        to that vehicle's risks. Fund shareholders will indirectly bear their
        proportionate share of the acquired fund's fees and expenses (including
        advisory fees), in addition to fees and expenses the Fund bears
        directly.
        <br />
        <br />
        Under Section 12(d)(1), immediately after purchase the Fund may not: (1)
        own more than 3% of the acquired company's outstanding voting stock; (2)
        invest in the acquired company's securities with an aggregate value
        exceeding 5% of the Fund's total assets; or (3) invest in the securities
        of the acquired company and all other investment companies in excess of
        10% of the Fund's total assets. To the extent permitted by law or
        regulation, the Fund may invest in money market funds beyond these
        limits.
        <br />
        <br />
        Registered funds may invest in other investment companies beyond Section
        12(d)(1) limits if certain conditions are met. The Fund may rely on Rule
        12d1-4, which provides an exemption allowing investments in other
        registered funds, including ETFs, subject to conditions (for example,
        the Fund and its advisory group may not control, individually or in the
        aggregate, an acquired fund, generally meaning ownership of no more than
        25% of the voting securities of a registered open-end fund).
        <br />
        <br />
        The Fund may also rely on Section 12(d)(1)(F) and Rule 12d1-3, which
        provide an exemption permitting investment in other registered funds
        (including ETFs) if, among other conditions: (1) the Fund, together with
        its affiliates, acquires no more than 3% of the outstanding voting stock
        of any acquired fund; and (2) sales loads on Shares do not exceed FINRA
        Rule 2830 limits.
        <br />
        <br />
        The Fund may invest in exchange-traded funds to obtain exposure to the
        Index or to a substantially similar index, including for cash
        equitization, to facilitate daily rebalancing, or during portfolio
        transitions. Such use may increase tracking error and costs relative to
        holding derivatives or the underlying constituents directly.
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>Money Market Funds</b>
        <br />
        <br />
        The Fund may invest in underlying money market funds that seek to
        maintain a stable $1 NAV ("stable NAV" funds) or whose share prices
        fluctuate ("variable NAV" funds). Investments in stable NAV funds can
        still lose value. Variable NAV funds can be worth more or less than the
        Fund paid when sold. Neither type is designed to provide capital
        appreciation. Certain money market funds may impose liquidity fees or
        temporarily suspend redemptions if liquidity falls below required
        thresholds. Shares of money market funds are not insured or guaranteed
        by the U.S. government or any government agency, and there is no
        assurance that a money market fund will maintain a stable price.
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>Other Short-Term Instruments</b>
        <br />
        <br />
        For liquidity or other purposes, the Fund may hold short-term
        instruments on an ongoing basis, including but not limited to: (1)
        shares of money market funds; (2) obligations of the U.S. government,
        its agencies, or instrumentalities (including government-sponsored
        enterprises); (3) negotiable certificates of deposit ("CDs"), bankers'
        acceptances, fixed time deposits, and other obligations of U.S. and
        non-U.S. banks (including foreign branches) and any similar
        institutions; (4) commercial paper rated Prime-1 by Moody's Investors
        Service or A-1 by S&P Global Ratings, or of comparable quality if
        unrated as determined by the Adviser; (5) non-convertible corporate debt
        with remaining maturities of 397 days or less that meets Rule 2a-7
        rating criteria; and (6) short-term, U.S. dollar-denominated obligations
        of non-U.S. banks (including their U.S. branches) that, in the Adviser's
        opinion, are of comparable quality to eligible U.S. bank obligations.
        Such instruments may be purchased on a current or forward-settled basis.
        Time deposits are non-negotiable bank deposits for a stated period and
        rate. Bankers' acceptances are time drafts drawn on banks, typically in
        international trade.
        <br /><br />
        Forward-settling short-term instruments that do not settle within 35
        days, or that otherwise use a non-standard settlement cycle, may be
        treated as derivatives under Rule 18f-4.
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>Securities Lending</b>
        <br />
        <br />
        If approved by the Board, the Fund may lend portfolio securities to
        qualified borrowers. Borrowers must provide collateral at least equal to
        the current value of the loaned securities and maintain such collateral
        while the loan is outstanding. The Fund may recall a securities loan at
        any time and recall the securities. The Fund will receive the value of
        any interest or cash/non-cash distributions on loaned securities;
        substitute payments in lieu of dividends generally do not qualify as
        qualified dividend income.
        <br />
        <br />
        For cash-collateralized loans, the borrower typically receives a fee
        based on the cash collateral; the Fund seeks to earn more on reinvested
        cash collateral than it pays to the borrower. For non-cash collateral,
        the borrower pays the Fund a fee based on the value of securities on
        loan. Cash collateral may be reinvested in short-term instruments,
        either directly or through joint accounts or money market funds, which
        may be managed by the Adviser.
        <br />
        <br />
        The Fund may share a portion of lending income with borrowers as
        described above and with one or more lending agents approved by the
        Board. Lending agents administer the program under Board-approved
        guidelines, including delivering and recalling securities, obtaining and
        maintaining collateral, monitoring collateral and loan values daily,
        requesting collateral adjustments, and providing recordkeeping and
        accounting.
        <br />
        <br />
        While securities are on loan, the Fund generally does not have the right
        to vote those securities. The Fund may recall securities on loan in
        order to vote if the Adviser determines that a particular vote is
        expected to have a material effect on the Fund and that recalling the
        securities is in the best interests of shareholders.
        <br />
        <br />
        Securities lending involves risks, including operational risk
        (settlement or accounting issues), "gap" risk (a mismatch between
        returns on collateral reinvestment and fees owed to the borrower), and
        credit, legal, counterparty, and market risks. If a borrower fails to
        return securities, the Fund could incur a loss if collateral liquidation
        proceeds do not at least equal the value of the loaned securities plus
        costs to purchase replacements.
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>Tax Risks</b>
        <br />
        <br />
        You should consider the tax treatment of an investment in Shares. The
        tax information in the Prospectus and this SAI is general in nature.
        Consult your tax adviser about the federal, state, local, and non-U.S.
        tax consequences of investing in Shares.
        <br />
        <br />
        Unless Shares are held through a tax-deferred or other tax-advantaged
        account (such as an individual retirement account), you should consider
        potential tax consequences when the Fund makes distributions or when you
        sell Shares.
        <br />
        <br />
        Use of derivatives and short-term instruments may affect the timing,
        amount, and character of the Fund's income and gains. Certain
        derivatives may be subject to special tax rules (including, without
        limitation, the mark-to-market rules for section 1256 contracts, the
        straddle rules, and wash sale rules). These rules can cause income to be
        recognized without a corresponding receipt of cash, can accelerate or
        defer recognition of income or loss, and can convert long-term capital
        gains into short-term capital gains. The Fund intends to monitor its
        investments and to structure its activities to qualify each taxable year
        as a regulated investment company under Subchapter M of the Internal
        Revenue Code.
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>Temporary Defensive Strategies</b>
        <br />
        <br />
        Under normal market conditions, the Fund seeks to remain fully invested
        in accordance with its principal strategies. In adverse market,
        economic, political, or other conditions, the Fund may, for temporary
        defensive purposes, invest up to 100% of its assets in cash or cash
        equivalents, such as U.S. government obligations, investment-grade debt,
        and other money market instruments. Taking a defensive position may
        prevent the Fund from achieving its investment objective. During any
        such defensive period, the Founder-Led 2x Daily ETF will not seek to
        achieve a daily 2x return and may hold a substantial portion of its
        assets in cash or cash equivalents.

        <h3>INVESTMENT RESTRICTIONS</h3>
        <br />
        The Trust has adopted the following investment restrictions as
        fundamental policies with respect to the Fund. These restrictions cannot
        be changed for the Fund without the approval of the holders of a
        majority of the Fund's outstanding voting securities. For purposes of
        the 1940 Act, a "majority of the outstanding voting securities" means
        the lesser of: (1) 67% or more of the voting securities present (if
        holders of more than 50% of the outstanding voting securities are
        present or represented by proxy); or (2) more than 50% of the
        outstanding voting securities of the Fund.
        <br />
        <br />
        Except with the approval of a majority of the outstanding voting
        securities, the Fund may not:
        <br />
        <br />
        <ul>
          <li>
            1. Borrow money or issue senior securities, as that term is defined
            in the 1940 Act, except to the extent permitted by the 1940 Act.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            2. Make loans, except to the extent permitted under the 1940 Act.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            3. Purchase or sell real estate, except when obtained through
            ownership of securities or other instruments and only to the extent
            allowed by the 1940 Act. This does not prevent the Fund from
            investing in securities or other instruments backed by real estate,
            real estate investment trusts ("REITs"), or securities of companies
            engaged in the real estate business.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            4. Purchase or sell commodities, except when exposure arises
            incidentally through other instruments and only as permitted by the
            1940 Act. This does not prevent the Fund from purchasing or selling
            options and futures contracts or from investing in securities or
            other instruments backed by physical commodities.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            5. Underwrite securities issued by other persons, except to the
            extent permitted under the 1940 Act.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            6. Concentrate its investments (that is, invest more than 25% of
            total assets) in any one industry or group of related industries,
            except that the Fund will mirror the Index's level of industry
            concentration. For this test, U.S. government securities (and
            agencies/instrumentalities), repurchase agreements backed by U.S.
            government securities, investment companies, and municipal
            securities are not treated as belonging to any industry.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        In determining compliance with its concentration policy, the Fund will
        "look through" to the holdings of any investment company that discloses
        its portfolio daily. If an acquired fund does not publish holdings daily
        but states that it concentrates, or otherwise discloses concentration in
        a particular industry or group of industries, the Fund will treat it as
        concentrated accordingly. Additionally, in determining compliance with
        the fundamental investment concentration policy, the Fund will look
        through to the ultimate user or use of proceeds of private-activity
        municipal bonds to assign their industry.
        <br />
        <br />
        For purposes of applying the concentration policy, the Fund may classify
        issuers by industry using any reasonable industry classification system,
        including SIC, NAICS, GICS, ICB, or a classification system developed by
        the Adviser. Classifications and the levels at which concentration is
        measured may differ from those used by other series of the Trust.
        <br />
        <br />
        For the Founder-Led 2x Daily ETF, the Fund will generally treat exposure
        obtained through derivatives referencing the Index as exposure to the
        industries represented in the Index, typically in proportion to the
        notional exposure of those derivatives.
        <br />
        <br />
        If a percentage limitation is satisfied at the time of investment or
        contract, a subsequent increase or decrease resulting from any change in
        value or in total or net assets will not, by itself, result in a
        violation of such restriction, except that the percentage limits on
        borrowing and on illiquid investments are monitored on a continuous
        basis.

        <h3>EXCHANGE LISTING AND TRADING</h3>
        <br />
        Shares are listed for trading and trade throughout the day on the
        Exchange.
        <br />
        <br />
        The Exchange may halt trading in the Shares for reasons that, in the
        judgment of the Exchange, make trading inadvisable, including without
        limitation extraordinary market volatility; trading halts in securities,
        instruments, or financial indexes underlying the Fund's portfolio; or
        the unavailability of key information such as an intraday indicative
        value.
        <br />
        <br />
        There can be no assurance that the Fund will continue to meet the
        Exchange's requirements necessary to maintain the listing of Shares. The
        Exchange may, but is not required to, remove Shares of the Fund from
        listing under any of the following circumstances: (1) the Exchange
        becomes aware that the Fund is no longer eligible to operate in reliance
        on Rule 6c-11 under the 1940 Act; (2) the Fund no longer complies with
        the Exchange's requirements for Shares; or (3) such other event or
        condition exists that, in the opinion of the Exchange, makes continued
        listing imprudent. The Exchange will also delist the Shares upon the
        Fund's termination.
        <br />
        <br />
        The Trust reserves the right to adjust the price levels of Shares in the
        future to help maintain convenient trading ranges for investors. Any
        such changes would be implemented via stock splits or reverse stock
        splits.

        <h3>MANAGEMENT OF THE TRUST</h3>
        <br />
        <b>Board Responsibilities.</b> The Board oversees the management and
        operations of the Trust. As with other mutual funds and ETFs, the
        day-to-day management and operations of the Trust are carried out by
        service providers to the Trust, including the Adviser, the Distributor,
        the Administrator, the Custodian, and the Transfer Agent, each of which
        is discussed elsewhere in this SAI. The Board has appointed certain
        senior personnel of the Administrator as officers of the Trust, with
        responsibility to monitor the Trust's operations and report to the
        Board. In carrying out its oversight, the Board receives regular reports
        from these officers and from the Trust's service providers. For example,
        the Treasurer reports on financial reporting matters and the President
        reports on operational matters. In addition, the Adviser provides
        regular reports regarding the investment strategy and performance of the
        Fund. The Board has appointed a Chief Compliance Officer who administers
        the Trust's compliance program and reports regularly to the Board on
        compliance matters. These reports are provided as part of formal Board
        meetings, typically held quarterly and often in person, during which the
        Board reviews recent operations. Between formal meetings, members of the
        Board may also meet with management in less formal settings to discuss
        Trust matters. The role of the Board, and of each Trustee, is one of
        oversight rather than day-to-day management; this oversight role does
        not make the Board a guarantor of the Trust's investments, operations,
        or activities.
        <br />
        <br />
        As part of its oversight function, the Board receives and reviews a
        variety of different risk management reports and discusses risk matters
        with appropriate management and other personnel. Because risk management
        encompasses many elements (for example, investment risk, issuer and
        counterparty risk, compliance risk, operational and business continuity
        risks), oversight of different categories of risk is handled in
        different ways. The Board meets regularly with the Chief Compliance
        Officer to discuss compliance and operational risks, and the Audit
        Committee meets with the Trust's independent registered public
        accounting firm regarding, among other things, the internal control
        structure of the Trust's financial reporting function.
        <br />
        <br />
        The full Board also receives reports from the Adviser regarding the
        Fund's investment risks. From time to time, the Board receives
        additional reports from the Administrator and the Adviser regarding
        enterprise risk management.
        <br />
        <br />
        The Board recognizes that not all risks that may affect the Fund can be
        identified or quantified; that it may not be practical or cost-effective
        to eliminate or mitigate certain risks; that certain risks (such as
        investment risk) may be necessary to achieve the Fund's goals; and that
        the processes and controls used to address risks have inherent
        limitations. Moreover, the risk reports provided to the Board are
        typically summaries. Most of the Fund's investment management and
        business affairs are conducted by or through the Adviser and other
        service providers, each operating under its own risk management policies
        and practices, which may differ from those of the Trust or from one
        another in priorities, resources, and control effectiveness. For these
        and other reasons, the Board's ability to monitor and manage risk, as a
        practical matter, has limitations.

      <div align="LEFT">
        <b>Members of the Board.</b>
        <br />
        The Board is composed of five members, three of whom are not "interested
        persons" of the Trust, as that term is defined in the Investment Company
        Act of 1940, as amended (the "1940 Act") (the "Independent Trustees").
        Nicolas S. Laqua serves as Chair of the Board and is an interested
        person of the Trust. The Board includes a majority (60%) of Independent
        Trustees.
      </div>

      <br />

      <div align="LEFT">
        The Board believes its current leadership structure is appropriate for
        the Trust. A Lead Independent Trustee acts as the primary liaison
        between the Independent Trustees and management; [Conor Murray]
        currently serves as Lead Independent Trustee. The Board further believes
        this structure supports effective oversight and facilitates the
        efficient flow of information from Fund management to the Independent
        Trustees.

        <h3>Individual Trustee Qualifications.</h3>
        <br />
        The Board has determined that each Trustee brings skills, experience,
        and attributes that, in the aggregate, are appropriate for service on
        the Board given the Trust's business and structure. Among other things,
        the Trustees collectively bring experience in technology and data
        systems, corporate finance and capital markets, and venture formation
        and growth investing, as well as risk oversight and investment
        management oversight. The Board conducts an annual self-assessment of
        its effectiveness and that of its committees.
        <br />
        <br />
        In addition, the Board has concluded that each Trustee should serve
        based on the following, among other factors:
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>[Conor Murray].</b> The Board has concluded that Mr. Murray
            should serve as a Trustee because of his leadership founding and
            operating an investment-technology firm and his prior work building
            systematic investing, risk-control, and portfolio-analytics
            platforms. In roles including Co-founder and Chief Executive Officer
            of OpenInvest (a J.P. Morgan company), Technology Associate at
            Bridgewater Associates, and Analyst in Morgan Stanley's Financial
            Sponsors M&A Group, he developed expertise in capital markets,
            portfolio construction and trading systems, data and enterprise
            technology, and operational oversight. The Board believes Mr.
            Murray's experience, qualifications, attributes, and skills, on an
            individual basis and in combination with those of the other
            Trustees, equip him to oversee investment and operational risk,
            valuation and fair-value processes, financial reporting and
            disclosure controls, information security and business continuity,
            and service-provider oversight with respect to the Trust.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <b>[Bryant Lee].</b> The Board has concluded that Mr. Lee should
            serve as a Trustee because of his operational, legal, and governance
            experience leading technology-enabled businesses and advising growth
            companies. As Chief Executive Officer and Co-founder of Vaero and
            previously as Co-founder/Chief Executive Officer and later Strategic
            Advisor at Cognition IP, with earlier service as a patent litigation
            attorney at Covington &amp; Burling LLP, Mr. Lee brings experience
            in capital raising and budgeting, contract negotiation,
            intellectual-property strategy, regulatory and compliance oversight,
            and service-provider management. The Board believes Mr. Lee's
            experience, qualifications, attributes, and skills, on an individual
            basis and in combination with those of the other Trustees, equip him
            to oversee risk management, financial and operational controls,
            disclosure and governance practices, and third-party
            service-provider oversight with respect to the Trust.
          </li>

          <br />
          <li>
            <b>[Jenny Xiao].</b> The Board has concluded that Ms. Xiao should
            serve as a Trustee because of her investment and research experience
            in artificial intelligence and economics, including capital
            allocation and due diligence for early-stage technology companies.
            Ms. Xiao serves as a Partner at Leonis Capital and previously
            conducted research at OpenAI and Epoch AI and served as a Research
            Fellow at the Future of Humanity Institute (Oxford); she has
            doctoral-level training at Columbia University focused on AI/ML and
            economics. The Board believes Ms. Xiao's experience, qualifications,
            attributes, and skills, on an individual basis and in combination
            with those of the other Trustees, equip her to oversee valuation,
            risk assessment, technology and data considerations, and strategic
            planning with respect to the Trust.
          </li>

          <br />
          <li>
            <b>Nicolas S. Laqua.</b> The Board has concluded that Mr. Laqua
            should serve as a Trustee because of his executive leadership and
            oversight in acquisitions, capital markets, insurance distribution,
            and software businesses. This includes service as Chief Executive
            Officer and Director at Corgi Insurance Services, Inc. and Basket
            Entertainment, Inc., and as a Director at Bangers Snacks, Inc.,
            together with practical familiarity with regulated insurance
            operations as a director and chief executive of an insurance agency.
            The Board believes Mr. Laqua's experience, qualifications,
            attributes, and skills, on an individual basis and in combination
            with those of the other Trustees, equip him to oversee financial
            reporting and disclosure controls, valuation, capital allocation and
            financing considerations, risk management, and service provider
            oversight with respect to the Trust.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <b>Emily Z. Yuan.</b> The Board has concluded that Ms. Yuan should
            serve as a Trustee because of her operational leadership and
            oversight in acquisitions, capital markets, insurance, and software
            companies. This is including service as Chief Operations Officer and
            Director at Corgi Insurance Services, Inc. and Basket Entertainment,
            Inc., and as a Director at Bangers Snacks, Inc., together with
            technical training in computer science at Stanford University and
            her familiarity with regulatory requirements as a director of an
            insurance agency. The Board believes Ms. Yuan's experience,
            qualifications, attributes, and skills, on an individual basis and
            in combination with those of the other Trustees, demonstrate the
            requisite capabilities to carry out oversight responsibilities with
            respect to the Trust.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        The information above is not exhaustive; many Trustee attributes involve
        qualitative elements such as integrity, diligence, judgment, the ability
        to work collaboratively, and a demonstrated commitment to shareholder
        interests.

        <h3>Board Committees.</h3>
        The Board has established the following standing committees, each
        composed solely of Independent Trustees and operating under a
        Board-approved written charter.
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>Audit Committee.</b> The Audit Committee is composed of [Bryant Lee]
        (Chair), [Conor Murray], and [Jenny Xiao]. The Audit Committee oversees
        the Trust's accounting, financial reporting, and internal control
        processes; the quality and integrity of the Trust's financial
        statements; and the qualifications, independence, and performance of the
        Trust's independent registered public accounting firm. Among other
        responsibilities, the Audit Committee pre-approves audit and permissible
        non-audit services for the Trust, reviews audit plans and results, and
        serves as a forum for communications among the independent auditors,
        management, and the Board regarding accounting and financial reporting
        matters. As of the date of this SAI, the Audit Committee met one time

        representing the Trust who becomes aware of evidence of a material
        violation by the Trust or by an officer, director, employee, or agent of
        the Trust may report such evidence to the QLCC as an alternative to the
        reporting process described in 17 C.F.R. § 205.3(b). As of the date of

        recommends candidates for nomination to the Board as needed; oversees
        the Board's annual self-assessment; and reviews Trustee compensation.
        The Committee considers whether or not to consider
        shareholder-recommended nominees. The Committee meets as necessary, but
        at least annually. Because the Funds have not yet commenced operations,
        the Committee has not yet met as of the date of this SAI.

        The Funds are required to show the dollar-amount ranges of each
        Trustee's beneficial ownership of Shares of each Fund and of the Trust's
        other series as of the end of the most recently completed calendar year.
        "Beneficial ownership" is determined in accordance with Rule 16a-1(a)(2)

        <br />
        <br />
        As of the date of this SAI, the Funds had not commenced operations and

        any series of the Trust.

        <h3>CODES OF ETHICS</h3>
        <br />
        The Trust and Corgi Strategies, LLC (the "Adviser") have each adopted
        Codes of Ethics (the "Codes") pursuant to Rule 17j-1 under the
        Investment Company Act of 1940 (the "1940 Act"). The Codes are intended
        to prevent affiliated persons of the Trust and the Adviser from engaging
        in fraudulent, deceptive or manipulative conduct in connection with
        securities held or to be acquired by a Fund (which may also be held by
        persons subject to the Codes).
        <br />
        <br />
        Subject to preclearance and other restrictions, each Code permits
        personal securities transactions by personnel, including transactions in
        securities that may also be purchased or held by a Fund. The distributor
        (the "Distributor") expects to rely on the principal underwriter
        exception in Rule 17j-1(c)(3) to the extent applicable (including where
        the Distributor is not affiliated with the Trust or the Adviser and no
        officer, director or general partner of the Distributor serves in such
        capacity with the Trust or the Adviser).
        <br />
        <br />
        There can be no assurance that the Codes will prevent all such conduct.
        Copies of the Codes may be reviewed at the SEC's website, www.sec.gov .

        <h3>PROXY VOTING POLICIES</h3>
        <br />
        The Board has delegated responsibility for voting proxies for portfolio
        securities to the Adviser, subject to Board oversight. Proxies are to be
        voted in the best interests of each Fund and its shareholders and in
        compliance with applicable law. The Adviser has adopted proxy voting
        policies and guidelines (the "Proxy Voting Policies"), which the Trust
        has approved for use when voting proxies on behalf of the Funds.
        <br />
        <br />
        Generally, absent a conflict of interest, the Adviser will vote for
        routine matters (for example, the election of directors, ratification of
        auditors, and conforming amendments to organizational documents), and
        will evaluate non-routine and contested matters case-by-case. The Proxy
        Voting Policies address the identification of, and response to, material
        conflicts of interest.
        <br />
        <br />
        The Trust's Chief Compliance Officer monitors the effectiveness of the
        Proxy Voting Policies.
        <br />
        <br />
        When available, information regarding how a Fund voted proxies during
        the most recent 12-month period ended June 30 will be available (1)
        without charge upon request by email to compliance@founderledfunds.com,

        <h3>INVESTMENT ADVISER</h3>
        <br />
        Corgi Strategies, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company with its
        principal office at 473 Pine St, Floor 5, San Francisco, CA 94104,
        serves as investment adviser to the Funds and is responsible for overall
        management of the Funds' business and day-to-day portfolio management,
        subject to the oversight of the Board. Registration of the Adviser with
        the SEC under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 is pending.
        <br />
        <br />
        Under an investment advisory agreement between the Trust, on behalf of
        each Fund, and the Adviser (the "Advisory Agreement"), the Adviser
        provides investment advice and portfolio management and arranges for
        necessary operational services, including, without limitation, transfer
        agency, custody, fund administration and fund accounting, and other
        services reasonably required for Fund operations. In exchange for a
        single unitary advisory fee, the Adviser has agreed to pay, from the
        fee, substantially all ordinary operating expenses of each Fund, except
        for the "Excluded Expenses" described in the Prospectus. Each Fund pays
        the Adviser an annual unitary advisory fee, calculated daily and paid
        monthly based on the Fund's average daily net assets, at the following
        rates: Founder-Led ETF (ticker: FDRS) 0.49%; Founder-Led 2x Daily ETF
        (ticker: FDRX) 1.08%. The fee rates for each Fund are set forth in
        Schedule A to the Advisory Agreement and may be amended from time to
        time to add or remove Funds and/or adjust a Fund's fee, in each case
        upon approval in the manner required by Article 8 of the Advisory
        Agreement.
        <br />
        <br />
        The Advisory Agreement will continue in effect for an initial two-year
        term for each Fund and, thereafter, from year to year if such
        continuance is approved at least annually (1) by a majority of the
        Trustees who are not "interested persons" of the Trust or the Adviser,
        and (2) by either the Board or a vote of a majority of the outstanding
        Shares of the relevant Fund. The Advisory Agreement will terminate
        automatically in the event of its assignment and may be terminated by
        the Trust or the Adviser upon 60 days' written notice.
        <br />
        <br />
        The Adviser and its affiliates will not be liable to the Trust or any
        shareholder for any error of judgment or mistake of law or for any loss
        suffered by the Trust or a Fund in connection with the performance of
        the Advisory Agreement, except for losses resulting from willful
        misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence or reckless disregard of its
        duties.

        <h3>PORTFOLIO MANAGERS</h3>
        <br />
        Each Fund is managed by Brianna A. Lynch, a portfolio manager of the
        Adviser (the "Portfolio Manager"). The Portfolio Manager is not
        responsible for any other accounts as of [ ], 2025.
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>Portfolio Manager Fund Ownership.</b> The SEC requires disclosure of
        the dollar range of each Portfolio Manager's beneficial ownership of
        Shares of each Fund as of the end of the most recently completed fiscal
        year, using prescribed ranges. As of the date of this SAI, the Funds had
        not commenced operations and no Shares were owned by the Portfolio
        Managers.
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>Portfolio Manager Compensation.</b> Portfolio managers receive a
        fixed base salary and an annual discretionary bonus. Bonus
        determinations consider the Adviser's overall revenues and
        profitability, the portfolio managers' responsibilities and
        contributions to the investment process, teamwork, risk management and
        compliance. Compensation is not based on the investment performance of
        any particular account, including Founder-Led ETF and Founder-Led 2x
        Daily ETF. Portfolio managers may also be eligible for long-term
        incentive awards (e.g., membership units or profit interests) that vest
        over 4 years. Portfolio managers do not receive compensation from index
        licensing revenue related to the Founder-Led Index.
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>Conflicts of Interest.</b> Managing multiple accounts (including
        other registered funds and separate accounts) may create potential
        conflicts of interest. For example, a Portfolio Manager may have an
        incentive to favor an account that pays a performance-based fee or a
        higher advisory fee; knowledge of Fund trades could be used for the
        benefit of other accounts; or investment opportunities could be
        allocated among accounts. The Adviser has policies and procedures
        designed to identify and mitigate such conflicts, including trade
        aggregation and allocation procedures intended to provide fair and
        equitable treatment over time.

        The Trust expects to enter into a distribution agreement (the

        Distributor will act as principal underwriter for the Funds and will
        distribute shares of the Funds ("Shares") on a best efforts basis.
        Shares are offered for sale by the Distributor only in Creation Units.
        The Distributor will not distribute Shares in amounts smaller than a
        Creation Unit and does not maintain a secondary market in Shares. The
        principal business address of the Distributor is [ ].
        <br />
        <br />
        Acting as agent for the Trust, the Distributor will review and transmit
        orders for the purchase and redemption of Creation Units. Any
        subscription or order will not be binding on a Fund until accepted by
        the Trust or its designee. The Distributor is, or will be, a
        broker-dealer registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and a
        member of FINRA.
        <br />
        <br />
        The Distributor may enter into arrangements with securities dealers and
        other firms ("Soliciting Dealers") to solicit orders for Creation Units
        of Shares. Such Soliciting Dealers may also be Authorized Participants
        (as described in "Procedures for Purchase and Redemption of Creation
        Units" below) or participants in DTC.
        <br />
        <br />
        The Distribution Agreement will remain in effect for an initial two-year
        term from its effective date and may continue from year to year
        thereafter if such continuance is approved annually (1) by the Board of
        Trustees (the "Board") or by a vote of a majority of the outstanding
        voting securities of the applicable Fund and (2) by a majority of the
        Independent Trustees who have no direct or indirect financial interest
        in the Distribution Agreement or any related agreement, cast in person
        or as otherwise permitted by the Investment Company Act of 1940, as
        amended (the "1940 Act"). The Distribution Agreement may be terminated
        without penalty by the Trust on 60 days' written notice, when authorized
        either by a majority vote of the outstanding voting securities of the
        applicable Fund or by a vote of a majority of the Board (including a
        majority of the Independent Trustees), or by the Distributor on 60 days'
        written notice, and will terminate automatically in the event of its
        assignment. The Distribution Agreement limits the Distributor's
        liability to losses resulting from the Distributor's willful
        misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence, or reckless disregard of its
        obligations thereunder.
        <br />
        <br />
        The Funds are newly organized. As of the date of this SAI, no
        underwriting commissions have been incurred and the Distributor has not
        retained any amounts.
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>Intermediary Compensation.</b> From its own resources and not from
        Fund assets, the Adviser or its affiliates may make payments to
        broker-dealers, banks, and other financial intermediaries
        ("Intermediaries") in connection with activities related to the Funds,
        including marketing, education, and training support (for example,
        conferences, webinars, or printed materials). These arrangements are not
        financed by the Funds, are not included in the fee and expense
        information in the Prospectus, and do not affect the price investors pay
        to buy Shares or the proceeds investors receive when selling Shares.
        Such payments may be significant to an Intermediary and may create
        conflicts of interest by incentivizing the Intermediary or its financial
        professionals to recommend the Funds over other investments. Investors
        should contact their advisers or other financial professionals for more
        information about any such compensation. Intermediary information is
        current only as of the date of this SAI. Any payments made by the
        Adviser or its affiliates may create an incentive for an Intermediary to
        encourage customers to purchase Shares.
        <br />
        <br />
        Such compensation may be provided to Intermediaries that offer services
        to the Fund, including marketing and educational support (for example,
        through conferences, webinars, or printed materials). The Adviser will
        periodically review whether to continue these payments. Compensation to
        an Intermediary may be significant, and amounts that Intermediaries pay
        to your adviser, broker, or other investment professional, if any, may
        also be significant to them. Because Intermediaries may determine which
        investment options to make available or recommend, and what services to
        provide in connection with various products, based on the payments they
        receive or are eligible to receive, these arrangements create conflicts
        of interest between the Intermediary and its clients. For instance, such
        financial incentives may lead an Intermediary to recommend the Fund over
        other investments. The same conflict of interest may arise with respect
        to your adviser, broker, or other investment professional if they
        receive similar payments from their Intermediary firm.
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>Distribution (Rule 12b-1) Plan.</b> The Trust has adopted a
        Distribution and Service Plan pursuant to Rule 12b-1 under the 1940 Act
        (the "Plan") for each Fund. No payments under the Plan are expected to
        be made during the twelve (12) months from the date of this SAI. Fees
        under the Plan may be imposed only after approval by the Board,
        including a majority of the Independent Trustees.
        <br />
        <br />
        Continuance of the Plan must be approved annually by a majority of the
        Trustees of the Trust and by a majority of the Trustees who are not
        interested persons (as defined in the 1940 Act) of the Trust and who
        have no direct or indirect financial interest in the Plan or in any
        related agreements (the "Independent Trustees"). The Plan may be
        continued from year to year only if, at least annually, the Board,
        including a majority of the Independent Trustees, concludes that
        continuation of the Plan is likely to benefit shareholders. The Plan may
        be terminated at any time by a vote of the Board or by a vote of a
        majority of the outstanding voting securities of the applicable Fund.
        <br />
        <br />
        The Plan requires quarterly written reports to be provided to the Board
        of the amounts expended under the Plan and the purposes for which such
        expenditures were made. The Plan may not be amended to increase
        materially the amount that may be spent thereunder without approval by a
        majority of the outstanding voting securities of the applicable Fund.
        All material amendments of the Plan require approval by a majority of
        the Trustees of the Trust and a majority of the Independent Trustees.
        <br />
        <br />
        Under the Plan, each Fund may pay the Distributor an annual fee of up to
        0.25% of the Fund's average daily net assets. The Plan is characterized
        as a compensation plan because any distribution and/or shareholder
        servicing fee will be paid to the Distributor without regard to the
        Distributor's actual distribution expenses or payments to other
        financial intermediaries. The Trust intends to administer the Plan, if
        implemented, in accordance with its terms and applicable FINRA rules
        concerning sales charges.
        <br />
        <br />
        Subject to applicable law and regulation, payments under the Plan may be
        used to finance any activity that is primarily intended to result in the
        sale of Creation Units of a Fund or to provide, or arrange for others to
        provide, shareholder services and the maintenance of shareholder
        accounts. Such activities may include, but are not limited to: (1)
        delivering current Prospectuses, reports, notices, and similar materials
        to prospective purchasers of Creation Units; (2) advertising and other
        marketing or promotional services; (3) compensating others, including
        Authorized Participants with whom the Distributor has written
        agreements, for providing shareholder servicing on behalf of a Fund; (4)
        compensating certain Authorized Participants for assistance in
        distributing Creation Units, including related travel and communication
        expenses and the salaries and/or commissions of sales personnel; (5)
        payments to financial institutions and intermediaries such as banks,
        savings and loan associations, insurance companies, investment advisers,
        broker-dealers, mutual fund supermarkets, and affiliates of the Trust's
        service providers as compensation for services or reimbursement of
        expenses related to distribution assistance; (6) facilitating
        communications with beneficial owners of Shares, including the cost of
        providing, or paying others to provide, services to such beneficial
        owners (for example, responding to inquiries related to shareholder
        accounts); and (7) such other services and obligations as may be set
        forth in the Distribution Agreement.

        <h3>PORTFOLIO HOLDINGS DISCLOSURE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES</h3>
        The Board has approved written policies and procedures governing the
        disclosure of information about each Fund's portfolio holdings (the
        "Holdings Disclosure Policy"). For each Business Day on which a Fund is
        open for business, the Fund's full portfolio holdings are made publicly
        available through financial reporting and news services, including on
        publicly available internet websites, and/or on the Trust's website at
        www.founderledfunds.com. In addition, the composition of the Deposit
        Securities applicable to purchases and redemptions of Creation Units is
        generally disseminated prior to the opening of trading on the Exchange
        (as defined in the Prospectus) through the National Securities Clearing
        Corporation ("NSCC").
        <br />
        <br />
        For the avoidance of doubt, each Fund intends to make complete, daily
        portfolio information available, subject to applicable law and Exchange
        requirements. For the Founder-Led 2x Daily ETF ("FDRX"), daily
        disclosure includes derivatives and financing positions (for example,
        total return swaps) and any associated cash and collateral holdings.
        <br />
        <br />
        The Holdings Disclosure Policy permits disclosure of portfolio
        information to the Trust's service providers and other parties that have
        a legitimate business need for the information to provide services to
        the Trust, including the administrator, custodian, transfer agent and
        ETF order management agent, distributor, pricing and data vendors,
        auditors, legal counsel, index calculation agents, and other similar
        providers (collectively, "Service Providers"). Any such disclosure is
        made under conditions of confidentiality and solely for the purpose of
        providing services to the Trust. No Fund, the Adviser, or any affiliate
        receives compensation or other consideration in connection with the
        disclosure of non-public portfolio holdings information, other than fees
        paid to Service Providers for services rendered.
        <br />
        <br />
        The Trust's Chief Compliance Officer ("CCO") administers the Holdings
        Disclosure Policy, including maintaining a list of Service Providers and
        other parties that receive non-public holdings information and the
        timing of such disclosures, and reports to the Board at least annually
        regarding the operation of the policy and any material issues that have
        arisen.
        <br />
        <br />
        Subject to the Holdings Disclosure Policy, the CCO may authorize
        immaterial exceptions when the CCO determines that a disclosure serves a
        legitimate business purpose, is in the best interests of shareholders,
        and is subject to appropriate confidentiality protections. Any such
        exceptions will be documented and reported to the Board.

        <h3>DESCRIPTION OF SHARES</h3>
        The Agreement and Declaration of Trust (the "Declaration of Trust") of
        Corgi ETF Trust I (the "Trust") authorizes the issuance of an unlimited
        number of shares of beneficial interest, no par value per share, in one
        or more series and classes. Each Fund is a separate series of the Trust.
        Each share of a Fund represents an equal proportionate interest in the
        assets of that Fund and is entitled to dividends and distributions, when
        and if declared by the Board, and to a pro rata share of the Fund's net
        assets upon liquidation. Shares are fully paid and non-assessable when
        issued, and shareholders have no preemptive or cumulative voting rights.
        Each Share entitles its holder to one vote. The Trustees may establish
        additional series or classes and may divide or combine shares into a
        greater or lesser number without shareholder approval, as permitted by
        the Declaration of Trust. All consideration received for Shares of a
        particular series, and all assets in which such consideration is
        invested, belong to that series and are subject to its liabilities.
        <br />
        <br />
        Shares are issued only in book-entry form. The Trust does not issue
        share certificates. Shares are registered in the name of The Depository
        Trust Company ("DTC") or its nominee and are held in the account of a
        DTC Participants (or Indirect Participants). Beneficial ownership of
        Shares is reflected on the records of DTC and its participants, and
        transfers of ownership are effected only through those records. The
        Trust, the Funds, and their transfer agent do not have responsibility
        for the records of beneficial ownership maintained by DTC or its
        participants.
        <br />
        <br />
        Shares of all series of the Trust vote together as a single class,
        except that (i) if a matter affects only one series, that series votes
        separately, and (ii) if a matter affects a series differently from other
        series, that series votes separately on that matter. As a Delaware
        statutory trust, the Trust is neither required nor intends to hold
        annual shareholder meetings. The Trust will hold meetings of
        shareholders to elect Trustees or for other purposes as required by the
        Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the "1940 Act"), or as
        otherwise determined by the Board. The Trust will call a meeting of
        shareholders to consider the removal of one or more Trustees and certain
        other matters upon the written request of shareholders holding at least
        10% of the outstanding Shares of the Trust entitled to vote at such
        meeting.
        <br />
        <br />
        Under the Declaration of Trust, the Board has the authority to liquidate
        a Fund without shareholder approval. While the Board has no present
        intention to exercise this authority, the Board may do so if a Fund
        fails to achieve a viable size within a reasonable period or for such
        other reasons as the Board determines to be in the best interests of the
        Fund and its shareholders.

        <h3>LIMITATION OF TRUSTEES' LIABILITY</h3>
        The Declaration of Trust provides that a Trustee is liable only for
        losses resulting from the Trustee's own willful misfeasance, bad faith,
        gross negligence, or reckless disregard of the duties involved in the
        conduct of the office of Trustee. A Trustee is not liable for errors in
        judgment or mistakes of fact or law made in good faith.
        <br />
        <br />
        The Declaration of Trust provides for indemnification of Trustees and
        officers (and, upon due approval of the Trustees, other covered persons)
        for claims and expenses arising in connection with their service, except
        to the extent resulting from willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross
        negligence, or reckless disregard of duties.
        <br />
        <br />
        Nothing in this section protects or indemnifies any person against
        liability to which they would otherwise be subject under the federal
        securities laws.

        <h3>BROKERAGE TRANSACTIONS</h3>
        The Trust's policy for purchases and sales of portfolio securities for
        each Fund is to seek the most favorable overall terms reasonably
        available. Primary consideration is given to obtaining effective
        execution at competitive prices; this does not require that the lowest
        available commission be paid in every case. A constant focus on the
        lowest commission could, in some circumstances, impair effective
        portfolio management or the quality of execution and related services.
        <br />
        <br />
        In evaluating execution quality for a particular transaction, the
        Adviser may consider a range of factors, including but not limited to:
        price; commission or commission equivalents; spread; size and difficulty
        of the order; liquidity and market impact; timing and speed; likelihood
        of execution and settlement; access to block trading and willingness to
        commit capital; financial condition and operational capabilities of the
        broker; reliability and accuracy of communications and clearing; the use
        of alternative trading systems (including electronic crossing networks);
        and the value of research and brokerage services, if any, consistent
        with Section 28(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The relative
        importance of these factors will vary depending on the particular
        transaction.
        <br />
        <br />
        The Trust has adopted policies and procedures that prohibit considering
        the sale of Fund shares as a factor in selecting brokers or dealers. The
        Adviser owes a fiduciary duty of best execution and selects the broker
        or dealer it believes is most capable of providing the services
        necessary to obtain the most favorable execution under the
        circumstances.
        <br />
        <br />
        Subject to these policies, brokers or dealers selected to execute the
        Funds' portfolio transactions may include Authorized Participants or
        their affiliates (see "Purchase and Redemption of Shares in Creation
        Units"). An Authorized Participant or its affiliate may be selected in
        connection with an all-cash creation or redemption or with orders that
        include cash-in-lieu, provided such selection is consistent with best
        execution and the Trust's policies.
        <br />
        <br />
        For swaps and other bilateral derivatives, the Adviser selects
        counterparties based on a range of factors, which may include pricing,
        execution quality, creditworthiness, collateral terms, operational
        capabilities, and overall relationship. These transactions are not
        executed through traditional brokerage in the same manner as equity
        trades, and commissions may not be paid. For exchange-traded futures and
        options, the Fund incurs exchange fees and pays commissions or other
        charges to its futures commission merchants. The Adviser seeks best
        overall terms reasonably available under the circumstances.
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>Brokerage and Research Services; Section 28(e).</b> Where permitted
        by law, the Adviser may cause a Fund to pay a broker a commission in
        excess of that which another broker might have charged in recognition of
        brokerage and research services provided, consistent with Section 28(e).
        Research services may include, among other things, market data and
        analytics, portfolio analytics, execution management and order handling
        tools that are directly related to investment research, and access to
        company or industry information. The Adviser will not cause a Fund to
        pay a commission greater than is reasonable in relation to the value of
        the brokerage and research services provided, viewed in terms of either
        that particular transaction or the Adviser's overall responsibilities,
        in accordance with Section 28(e). The Adviser may also receive
        proprietary research that is bundled with execution services. The
        Adviser may use research services obtained for the benefit of any
        account it manages, and not all such services will necessarily be used
        in connection with the account that generated the commissions. This may
        create an incentive to select or recommend brokers based on the research
        services they provide; the Adviser monitors these arrangements and
        reports to the Board as part of the Trust's brokerage oversight program.
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>Aggregation and Allocation.</b> When the Adviser considers purchases
        or sales for a Fund at or about the same time as for other accounts it
        manages, transactions may be aggregated to seek more favorable
        execution. Orders are allocated among participating accounts in a manner
        the Adviser believes to be fair and equitable over time. Aggregation
        may, in some cases, adversely affect the price or size of the position
        for a Fund; in other cases, it may be beneficial, for example, by
        enabling participation in larger transactions or by reducing
        commissions.
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>Affiliated Brokerage; Principal Transactions.</b> Each Fund may
        effect brokerage transactions through registered broker-dealer
        affiliates of the Trust or the Adviser, to the extent permitted by the
        Investment Company Act of 1940 (the "1940 Act"), the Exchange Act, and
        SEC rules, including any applicable procedures adopted by the Board
        (including procedures consistent with Rule 17e-1 under the 1940 Act).
        Commissions paid to an affiliate will not exceed amounts that are
        reasonable and fair compared to commissions charged by others for
        comparable transactions. Principal transactions with affiliates are
        prohibited unless permitted by rule, regulation, or exemptive relief.
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>Directed Brokerage.</b> The Funds do not have any practice of
        directing brokerage for the promotion or sale of Fund shares. The Funds
        are newly organized and, as of the date of this SAI, have not paid
        commissions on brokerage transactions directed to brokers pursuant to
        any arrangement for research or brokerage services.
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>Regular Brokers or Dealers.</b> Each Fund is required to identify any
        securities of its "regular brokers or dealers" (as defined in the 1940
        Act) held at the close of its most recent fiscal year. Each Fund is new
        and, as of the date of this SAI, did not own equity securities of their
        regular brokers or dealers or their parent companies.
        <br />
        <br />
        Each Fund is newly organized and, as of the date of this SAI, has not
        paid any brokerage commissions.

        <h3>PORTFOLIO TURNOVER RATE</h3>
        The portfolio turnover rate is, in general terms, the percentage
        obtained by dividing the lesser of a Fund's purchases or sales of
        securities (excluding short-term instruments and securities received or
        delivered in-kind) by the average value of the Fund during the period. A
        rate of 100% indicates that the equivalent of the Fund's entire
        portfolio has been bought and sold during a year. Higher turnover may
        increase transaction costs and may affect the amount, timing, and
        character of distributions for tax purposes. To the extent a Fund
        realizes net short-term capital gains, distributions attributable to
        those gains will be treated as ordinary income for federal income tax
        purposes.
        <br />
        <br />
        Because the Founder-Led 2x Daily ETF rebalances exposure daily and
        primarily uses derivatives, its portfolio turnover rate (as calculated
        pursuant to SEC rules) may be higher than that of traditional index
        funds, and reported turnover may not fully reflect the extent of
        derivatives activity. Periods of elevated market volatility typically
        increase trading activity and costs.
        <br />
        <br />
        Each Fund is new and does not have a portfolio turnover rate to report
        as of the date of this SAI.

        <h3>BOOK ENTRY ONLY SYSTEM</h3>
        The Depository Trust Company ("DTC") acts as securities depository for
        the Shares. Shares are represented by securities registered in the name
        of DTC or its nominee, Cede &amp; Co., and are deposited with, or on
        behalf of, DTC. Certificates will not be issued for Shares.
        <br />
        <br />
        DTC is a limited-purpose trust company and a member of the Federal
        Reserve System, a "clearing agency" registered with the SEC, and a
        subsidiary of The Depository Trust &amp; Clearing Corporation. DTC holds
        securities of its participants ("DTC Participants") and facilitates the
        clearance and settlement of securities transactions among DTC
        Participants through electronic book-entry changes in accounts of DTC
        Participants, thereby eliminating the need for physical movement of
        certificates. DTC Participants include broker-dealers, banks, trust
        companies, clearing corporations, and other organizations. Access to the
        DTC system is also available to others such as banks, brokers, and
        dealers that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a
        DTC Participant, either directly or indirectly ("Indirect
        Participants").
        <br />
        <br />
        Beneficial ownership of Shares is limited to DTC Participants, Indirect
        Participants, and persons holding interests through DTC Participants or
        Indirect Participants (collectively, "Beneficial Owners"). Ownership of
        beneficial interests in Shares is shown on, and the transfer of
        ownership is effected only through, records maintained by DTC (for DTC
        Participants) and by DTC Participants (for Indirect Participants and
        Beneficial Owners). The Trust recognizes DTC or its nominee as the
        record owner of all Shares for all purposes. Beneficial Owners are not
        entitled to have Shares registered in their names and will not receive
        physical delivery of Share certificates. Beneficial Owners must rely on
        the procedures of DTC and the DTC Participant or Indirect Participant
        through which they hold Shares to exercise rights of a holder of Shares.
        <br />
        <br />
        Notices, statements, and other communications to Beneficial Owners will
        be transmitted through DTC and DTC Participants. Distributions of
        dividends and other amounts with respect to Shares will be made to DTC
        or its nominee, which will credit DTC Participants' accounts in
        proportion to their respective beneficial interests. Payments by DTC
        Participants to Indirect Participants and to Beneficial Owners will be
        governed by standing instructions and customary practices and are the
        responsibility of such DTC Participants and Indirect Participants, and
        not of the Trust, the Funds, or their service providers.
        <br />
        <br />
        DTC may discontinue providing depository services with respect to Shares
        at any time by giving reasonable notice in accordance with its
        procedures and applicable law. Under such circumstances, the Trust will
        seek a replacement for DTC to perform its functions at a comparable
        cost; if a replacement is not available, the Trust may make other
        arrangements, which may include issuing printed certificates, as
        permitted by applicable law (and, if required, in a manner satisfactory
        to the Fund's listing exchange). The Trust, the Funds, and their service
        providers have no responsibility for records, notices, or payments
        maintained or transmitted by DTC, DTC Participants, or Indirect
        Participants.

      <div align="LEFT">
        <h3>PURCHASE AND REDEMPTION OF SHARES IN CREATION UNITS</h3>
        The Trust issues and redeems shares of each Fund (the "Shares") only in
        aggregations of a specified number of Shares ("Creation Units") on a
        continuous basis, without a sales load but subject to applicable
        transaction fees. Creation and redemption orders are effected at the net
        asset value ("NAV") per Share next determined after an order is received
        in proper form and accepted on a Business Day by the Trust through its
        transfer agent (the "Transfer Agent") in accordance with an Authorized
        Participant Agreement (a "Participant Agreement"). Each Fund's NAV is
        calculated on each Business Day as of the scheduled close of regular
        trading on the primary listing exchange for the Shares (generally 4:00
        p.m., Eastern Time). A "Business Day" is any day on which the Fund's
        primary listing exchange (the "Exchange") is open for regular trading.
        The Funds do not issue fractional Creation Units. Each Creation Unit
        consists of 25,000 Shares (or such other amount as the Trust may
        determine and disclose).
        <br /><br />
        The Trust generally expects to permit or require cash creations and
        redemptions for the Founder-Led 2x Daily ETF in light of that Fund's use
        of derivatives to achieve its objective. From time to time, FDRX may
        require all-cash creations and/or redemptions. Cash transactions may
        cause the Fund to incur costs, including costs of entering into or
        unwinding derivatives positions, which may be passed through to
        Authorized Participants via transaction fees designed to approximate the
        Fund's costs.
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>Fund Deposit.</b> The consideration for a purchase of a Creation Unit
        (the "Fund Deposit") generally consists of (i) a designated basket of
        securities (the "Deposit Securities") together with (ii) a cash amount
        (the "Cash Component"). The Cash Component equals the difference between
        the NAV of a Creation Unit and the aggregate value of the Deposit
        Securities, and may be a positive or negative amount. The Trust may
        permit or require the substitution of cash in lieu of some or all
        Deposit Securities ("Deposit Cash"). When a Fund accepts cash (in whole
        or in part), the Fund may incur costs associated with acquiring
        portfolio positions that would otherwise have been delivered in kind;
        such costs may be borne by the Fund, by an Authorized Participant, or
        otherwise as set forth in the Participant Agreement. <br /><br />
        The Fund Deposit (Deposit Securities or Deposit Cash, as applicable,
        plus the Cash Component) represents the minimum initial and subsequent
        investment for a Creation Unit. Computation of the Cash Component
        excludes any stamp duties, transfer taxes, or other similar charges
        associated with the transfer of beneficial ownership of Deposit
        Securities, which are the responsibility of the Authorized Participant.
        <br /><br />
        <b>Daily Dissemination.</b> On each Business Day, prior to the opening
        of regular trading on the Exchange (currently 9:30 a.m., Eastern Time),
        the names and required quantities of Deposit Securities (or the required
        amount of Deposit Cash, as applicable) for each Fund, together with the
        Cash Component, are disseminated via the National Securities Clearing
        Corporation ("NSCC") based on information as of the close of the prior
        Business Day. The composition of the Fund Deposit is subject to change
        and may differ from a Fund's portfolio holdings for a variety of reasons
        (for example, corporate actions, index rebalances, or operational
        considerations). For the Founder-Led 2x Daily ETF ("FDRX"), which may
        obtain exposure through derivatives such as total return swaps, the
        Trust may from time to time require cash creations and/or cash
        redemptions, in whole or in part, to reflect the Fund's investment
        strategy. <br /><br />
        <b>Custom Baskets.</b> Each Fund may accept or deliver "custom baskets"
        (i.e., baskets that are not a pro rata slice of the Fund's portfolio)
        consistent with Rule 6c-11 under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as
        amended (the "1940 Act"). The Adviser has adopted written policies and
        procedures governing the construction, acceptance, and oversight of
        custom baskets, which are subject to Board of Trustees (the "Board")
        oversight. <br /><br />
        <b>Eligibility to Transact; Authorized Participants.</b>
        Orders for Creation Units may be placed only by entities that are (i)
        participants in the NSCC's Continuous Net Settlement system (each, a
        "Participating Party") or (ii) participants in The Depository Trust
        Company ("DTC") (each, a "DTC Participant") and, in each case, that have
        executed a Participant Agreement with respect to the relevant Fund (each
        such entity, an "Authorized Participant"). An Authorized Participant
        agrees, among other things, to pay the Cash Component, applicable
        creation transaction fees, and any taxes or other charges in connection
        with an order. <br /><br />
        An investor transacting through a broker that is not an Authorized
        Participant must route orders through an Authorized Participant, and
        such investor may incur additional charges. At any given time, only a
        limited number of broker-dealers may have executed a Participant
        Agreement, and only a subset may support all order types or
        international settlement capabilities.
        <br /><br />
        <b>Placing Purchase Orders; Cut-Offs.</b> All orders to purchase Shares
        directly from a Fund must be for one or more whole Creation Units and
        must be submitted in the manner and by the deadline specified in the
        Participant Agreement and/or applicable order form. Unless otherwise
        specified, the purchase order cut-off time is expected to be 4:00 p.m.
        Eastern Time and may be modified by the Fund. The date on which a
        purchase order (or a redemption order, as described below) is received
        in proper form and accepted is the "Order Placement Date." On days when
        the Exchange closes earlier than normal, the Funds may require that
        orders be placed earlier. If a market on which a Fund's portfolio
        investments principally trade is closed, the Fund generally will not
        accept orders on such day. <br /><br />
        <b
          >Delivery of the Fund Deposit; Settlement; Additional Cash Deposit.</b
        >
        Fund Deposits must be delivered by an Authorized Participant through DTC
        (for equity securities), through the Federal Reserve wire system (for
        cash), and/or through other arrangements acceptable to the Trust or its
        agents. The cash portion must be received by the custodian (the
        "Custodian") no later than the contractual settlement date. The typical
        settlement cycle for each creation transaction is one Business Day after
        the trade date ("T+1"), unless otherwise agreed by the Fund and the
        Authorized Participant or as permitted by Rule 15c6-1 under the
        Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act"). <br /><br />
        The Funds may permit a creation order to proceed before all Deposit
        Securities have been received. In such cases, the Authorized Participant
        must deposit additional cash collateral (the "Additional Cash Deposit")
        by 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time on the contractual settlement date (or such
        other time as specified). The Additional Cash Deposit is held in a
        non-interest bearing account and is subject to increase or decrease
        until all missing Deposit Securities are received. The Trust may
        purchase missing Deposit Securities at any time; the Authorized
        Participant will be liable to the Trust for any costs of such purchases
        (including any difference between the actual purchase price and the
        value used for Fund Deposit purposes, plus related transaction costs).
        Any unused portion of the Additional Cash Deposit will be returned once
        all missing Deposit Securities have been received or purchased and
        deposited into the Fund. If the Fund does not receive all required
        components by the specified time, the order may be canceled; upon
        written notice to the Transfer Agent, such canceled order may be
        resubmitted on the next Business Day using the then-current Fund
        Deposit.
        <br /><br />
        <b>Deemed Receipt; Proper Form.</b> An order is deemed received on the
        Business Day it is placed only if it is in proper form prior to the
        applicable cut-off time and federal funds in the appropriate amount are
        deposited with the Custodian on the contractual settlement date by 4:00
        p.m. Eastern Time (or such other time as specified). If proper form or
        funds are not timely received, the order may be rejected and the
        Authorized Participant may be liable for any resulting losses.
        <br /><br />
        <b>Issuance of Creation Units.</b> Except as otherwise provided,
        Creation Units will not be issued until (i) the Transfer Agent has
        verified receipt of the required Deposit Securities or Deposit Cash, as
        applicable, (ii) the Custodian has received the Cash Component and any
        required Additional Cash Deposit, and (iii) all other conditions to
        creation have been satisfied. Upon confirmation, the Trust will issue
        and deliver the Creation Units, typically no later than the contractual
        settlement date. The Authorized Participant is responsible for any
        losses resulting from untimely delivery of required components.
        <br /><br />
        <b>Acceptance or Rejection of Purchase Orders.</b> The Trust reserves
        the right to reject any creation order, including if: (1) the order is
        not in proper form; (2) the Fund Deposit (including the names or
        quantities of Deposit Securities or the amount of Deposit Cash) does not
        match the information disseminated through NSCC for that date; (3) the
        investor(s), upon obtaining the Shares ordered, would beneficially own
        80% or more of the outstanding Shares of the Fund (the Trust reserves
        the right to require information reasonably necessary to determine
        beneficial ownership for purposes of this 80% test); (4) acceptance of
        the Fund Deposit would, in the judgment of the Trust, be unlawful; (5)
        acceptance or receipt of the order would, in the opinion of counsel to
        the Trust, be unlawful; or (6) circumstances outside the control of the
        Trust, the Custodian, any sub-custodian, the Transfer Agent, and/or the
        Adviser make it impracticable to process orders. Illustrative examples
        include natural disasters; extreme weather; fires or floods; widespread
        utility or telecommunications outages; market-wide trading halts; or
        systems failures affecting the Trust, the distributor, the Custodian or
        any sub-custodian, the Transfer Agent, DTC, NSCC, the Federal Reserve
        System, or other participants. The Transfer Agent will notify a
        prospective creator and/or its Authorized Participant of any rejection.
        The Trust, the Transfer Agent, the Custodian, any sub-custodian, and the
        distributor have no duty to notify of defects or irregularities in any
        Fund Deposit and shall not be liable for failure to give such notice.
        The Trust will exercise any right to reject orders in a manner
        consistent with Rule 6c-11 and related SEC guidance, including with
        respect to limited suspensions and extraordinary circumstances, and in a
        manner designed not to impair the arbitrage mechanism. <br /><br />
        All questions as to the composition of the Fund Deposit, the number of
        shares of each Deposit Security, and the validity, form, eligibility,
        and acceptance of any securities or cash tendered will be determined by
        the Trust, and the Trust's determinations will be final and binding.
        <br /><br />
        <b>Creation Transaction Fees.</b> A fixed creation transaction fee may
        be imposed to offset transfer and other transaction costs associated
        with processing creation orders. The fixed fee is payable to the
        Custodian (or another service provider, as applicable) and applies to
        each creation order regardless of the number of Creation Units purchased
        in that order. The fixed fee may be changed from time to time and may be
        waived for certain orders if the Fund determines to waive all or part of
        the costs, or if another party (such as the Adviser) agrees to pay such
        fee. <br /><br />
        In addition, for cash creations, partial cash creations, or non-standard
        orders, a variable fee payable to the Fund of up to the maximum shown
        below, which may be charged in addition to the fixed transaction fee,
        may be charged to cover the Fund's trading costs, taxes, and other
        expenses related to purchasing portfolio investments with cash. The
        Adviser may determine not to impose a variable fee when it believes
        doing so is in the best interests of shareholders.

        Investors who use the services of a broker or other intermediary may be
        charged a fee for such services. Investors are responsible for any costs
        of transferring securities to or from their accounts as part of the
        creation process.
        <br /><br />
        <b>Risks of Purchasing Creation Units.</b> Purchases of Creation Units
        directly from a Fund involve certain legal risks. Because Shares may be
        continuously offered, a "distribution" could be occurring at any time.
        Depending on the facts and circumstances, activities of a shareholder
        may cause the shareholder to be deemed a statutory underwriter under the
        Securities Act of 1933 (the "Securities Act") and subject to prospectus
        delivery and liability provisions. For example, a shareholder may be
        deemed a statutory underwriter if it purchases Creation Units, breaks
        them into Shares, and sells those Shares directly to customers, or
        combines the creation of new Shares with an active selling effort.
        Whether a person is an underwriter depends on all facts and
        circumstances. Dealers participating in a distribution and dealing with
        Shares as part of an "unsold allotment" within the meaning of Section
        4(a)(3)(C) of the Securities Act may be unable to rely on the prospectus
        delivery exemption provided by Section 4(a)(3) of the Securities Act.
        <br /><br />
        <h3>Redemption.</h3>
        Shares may be redeemed only in Creation Units at the NAV next determined
        after a redemption request in proper form is received and accepted by
        the Fund through the Transfer Agent on a Business Day. Except upon
        liquidation of a Fund, the Trust does not redeem Shares in amounts less
        than a Creation Unit. Investors who are not Authorized Participants must
        accumulate sufficient Shares in the secondary market to constitute a
        Creation Unit to redeem. There can be no assurance that secondary-market
        liquidity will always permit assembly of a Creation Unit; investors
        should expect to incur brokerage and other costs in connection with
        aggregating Shares.
        <br /><br />
        Prior to the opening of regular trading on the Exchange on each Business
        Day, the Custodian, through NSCC, makes available the list of names and
        quantities of portfolio securities (the "Fund Securities") and the cash
        amount, if any, that will be applicable to redemption requests received
        that day in proper form. Fund Securities received upon redemption may
        differ from the Deposit Securities applicable to creations.
        <br /><br />
        Redemption proceeds are paid in kind, in cash, or a combination thereof,
        as determined by the Trust in its discretion. For in-kind redemptions,
        redemption proceeds for a Creation Unit generally consist of the Fund
        Securities announced for that day, plus or minus a cash amount equal to
        the difference between the NAV of the Shares being redeemed and the
        value of the Fund Securities (the "Cash Redemption Amount"), less
        applicable fees. When the value of the Fund Securities exceeds the NAV
        of the Shares being redeemed, the redeeming shareholder will be required
        to pay the difference in cash through its Authorized Participant. The
        Trust may, in its discretion, substitute cash for any Fund Security.
        <br /><br />
        The typical settlement cycle for each redemption transaction is T+1,
        unless otherwise agreed by the Fund and the Authorized Participant or as
        permitted by Rule 15c6-1 under the Exchange Act. In certain cases (for
        example, due to local market holidays or other market conditions),
        settlement of redemption proceeds may occur later.
        <br /><br />
        <b>Redemption Transaction Fees.</b> A fixed redemption transaction fee
        may be imposed to offset transfer and other transaction costs associated
        with processing redemption orders. The fixed fee is payable to the
        Custodian (or another service provider, as applicable) and applies to
        each redemption order, regardless of the number of Creation Units
        redeemed. The fixed fee may be changed from time to time and may be
        waived for certain orders if the Fund determines to waive all or part of
        the costs, or if another party (such as the Adviser) agrees to pay such
        fee. <br /><br />
        In addition, for cash redemptions, partial cash redemptions, or
        non-standard orders, a variable fee payable to the Fund of up to the
        maximum shown below, which may be charged in addition to the fixed
        transaction fee, may be charged to cover the Fund's trading costs,
        taxes, and other expenses related to selling portfolio investments to
        raise cash. The Adviser may determine not to impose a variable fee when
        it believes doing so is in the best interests of shareholders.

        Investors who use the services of a broker or other intermediary may be
        charged a fee for such services. Investors are responsible for any costs
        of transferring Fund Securities from the Trust to their account or as
        otherwise directed.
        <br /><br />
        <b>Procedures for Redemption of Creation Units; Cut-Offs.</b>
        Redemption orders must be submitted in proper form to the Transfer Agent
        by an Authorized Participant prior to 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time (or such
        other time as specified in the Participant Agreement and/or applicable
        order form). A redemption request is in proper form if: (i) the
        Authorized Participant has transferred, or caused to be transferred, the
        Creation Unit(s) being redeemed through DTC to the account of the
        Transfer Agent by the time specified; and (ii) the Transfer Agent has
        received an acceptable redemption request from the Authorized
        Participant within the time periods specified. If Shares are not
        received through DTC's facilities by the required time, or the request
        otherwise is not in proper form, the redemption request will be
        rejected. <br /><br />
        <b>Additional Redemption Procedures.</b> A redeeming shareholder or an
        Authorized Participant acting on its behalf must maintain appropriate
        custody arrangements to receive Fund Securities. The Trust may, in its
        discretion, require or permit cash redemptions. In either case, the
        redeeming investor will receive a cash amount equal to the NAV of the
        Shares next determined after receipt of a redemption request in proper
        form, less applicable fees and charges (including any variable fee for
        cash redemptions). Upon request, the Trust may deliver a basket of
        securities that differs from the announced Fund Securities but does not
        differ in NAV. <br /><br />
        Redemptions in kind are subject to applicable federal and state
        securities laws. The Trust reserves the right to redeem Creation Units
        for cash to the extent it could not lawfully deliver specific Fund
        Securities or could not do so without first registering such securities.
        An Authorized Participant or an investor for which it is acting that is
        subject to a legal restriction with respect to a particular Fund
        Security may receive an equivalent amount of cash. An Authorized
        Participant that is not a "qualified institutional buyer" ("QIB") as
        defined in Rule 144A under the Securities Act will be unable to receive
        Fund Securities that are restricted securities eligible for resale under
        Rule 144A; the Trust may require written confirmation of QIB status as a
        condition to delivery of such securities.
        <br /><br />
        <b>Suspension of Redemptions.</b> The right of redemption may be
        suspended or the date of payment postponed: (1) for any period when the
        Exchange is closed (other than customary weekend and holiday closings);
        (2) for any period when trading on the Exchange is suspended or
        restricted; (3) for any period when an emergency exists that makes it
        not reasonably practicable to dispose of Shares or determine NAV; or (4)
        in such other circumstances as are permitted by the SEC. The Trust will
        administer any suspension in a manner consistent with Rule 6c-11 and
        related SEC guidance and in a manner designed not to impair the
        arbitrage mechanism.

      <a name="sai-determination-of-nav"></a>
      <div align="LEFT">
        <h3>DETERMINATION OF NET ASSET VALUE</h3>
        NAV per Share for each Fund is computed by dividing the value of the
        Fund's net assets (the value of total assets minus total liabilities) by
        the total number of Shares outstanding, rounded to the nearest cent.
        Expenses and fees (including any management fees) accrue daily and are
        reflected in the determination of NAV.
        <br />
        <br />
        The NAV of each Fund is calculated by the Administrator as of the
        scheduled close of regular trading on the Fund's primary listing
        exchange (generally 4:00 p.m., Eastern Time) on each day that the
        exchange is open for regular trading. If market closures or early closes
        affect particular asset classes (for example, an early close for certain
        fixed-income markets announced by the Securities Industry and Financial
        Markets Association, "SIFMA"), valuations for those holdings may reflect
        the earlier close on such day.
        <br />
        <br />
        In valuing portfolio investments, each Fund generally uses market-based
        valuations. Prices may be obtained from one or more pricing services,
        directly from an exchange or trading venue, from quotations of major
        market makers or dealers, or, where appropriate, using amortized cost
        for short-term instruments. For investments that trade on an exchange, a
        market valuation generally refers to the last reported sale price or
        official closing price. Investments and other assets (and liabilities)
        denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollars are converted to U.S.
        dollars at current market rates as quoted by one or more sources on the
        valuation date.
        <br />
        <br />
        When market quotations are not "readily available" or are deemed
        unreliable, the Fund will determine a fair value in accordance with Rule
        2a-5 under the Investment Company Act of 1940. The Board has adopted
        valuation policies and procedures and has designated the Adviser as the
        Fund's valuation designee (the "Valuation Designee") pursuant to Rule
        2a-5 to perform fair value determinations, subject to Board oversight.
        Fair value methodologies may consider, among other things, evaluated
        prices from pricing services, model inputs, observable market data,
        corporate actions, trading halts, significant events occurring after
        market close, and, for derivatives, counterparty quotations and
        collateral. The use of fair value prices may result in values that
        differ from quoted or published prices and may cause the Fund's NAV to
        differ from the value of an index at a point in time.
        <br /><br />
        Derivatives used to obtain leveraged exposure (for example, swaps,
        futures, and options) are valued pursuant to the Fund's valuation
        procedures. Depending on the instrument, valuation inputs may include
        exchange settlement prices, quotations from one or more dealers or
        pricing services, models that reference observable market data, and,
        when appropriate, values of related instruments such as an
        exchange-traded fund designed to track the Fund's relevant reference
        asset or benchmark (particularly if that benchmark level is not computed
        as of the U.S. market close). When market quotations are not readily
        available or are deemed unreliable, such instruments are valued at fair
        value in good faith under the Fund's Rule 2a-5 procedures.

        <h3>DIVIDENDS AND DISTRIBUTIONS</h3>
        The following supplements, and should be read with, the Prospectus
        section titled "Dividends, Distributions, and Taxes."
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>General policies.</b> Each Fund intends to distribute substantially
        all of its net investment income, if any, at least annually, and to
        distribute any net realized capital gains to shareholders at least
        annually. The Funds may make additional distributions as necessary to
        meet distribution requirements under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986,
        as amended (the "Code"), in a manner consistent with the Investment
        Company Act of 1940 and to minimize federal excise taxes.
        <br />
        <br />
        Distributions of income and capital gains, if any, are declared and paid
        in cash. Dividends and other distributions on Shares are made on a pro
        rata basis to beneficial owners of record through Depository Trust
        Company ("DTC") participants and indirect participants, with proceeds
        transmitted by the Trust to DTC for allocation to DTC participants and
        then to beneficial owners.
        <br />
        <br />
        The Trust may declare special dividends or other distributions if, in
        its reasonable discretion, such action is necessary or advisable to
        maintain a Fund's status as a regulated investment company ("RIC") or to
        avoid Fund-level income or excise taxes on undistributed amounts. Each
        Fund intends to make distributions in amounts and at times intended to
        avoid the 4% federal excise tax described under "Federal Income Taxes"
        below.
        <br />
        <br />
        Use of derivatives may cause the Founder-Led 2x Daily ETF to recognize
        income, gain, or loss for tax and accounting purposes without a
        corresponding receipt or payment of cash in the same period. As a
        result, the Fund may be required to sell investments, including
        derivatives, at times it would not otherwise do so in order to meet
        distribution requirements.
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>Dividend reinvestment service.</b> The Trust does not offer a DTC
        book-entry dividend reinvestment service. However, certain
        broker-dealers may offer a dividend reinvestment service for beneficial
        owners through DTC participants. Investors should contact their brokers
        to determine availability, applicable procedures, and any deadlines. If
        such a service is used, distributions will be reinvested in additional
        whole Shares at the then-current NAV, and such reinvested amounts will
        be taxable to the same extent as if received in cash.

      <div align="LEFT">
        <a name="sai-federal-taxes"></a>
        <h3>FEDERAL INCOME TAXES</h3>
        The following is a summary of certain U.S. federal income tax
        considerations generally affecting the Funds and their shareholders. It
        supplements the Prospectus and is not a complete discussion of all tax
        matters that may be relevant. This summary is based on current
        provisions of the Code, Treasury regulations, judicial decisions, and
        administrative rulings and guidance, all of which are subject to change
        (possibly with retroactive effect). Investors should consult their own
        tax advisers about federal, state, local, and foreign tax consequences
        to them in light of their particular circumstances.
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>Taxation of the Funds.</b> Each Fund intends to elect and qualify
        each year for treatment as a RIC under the Code. If a Fund qualifies as
        a RIC and distributes its income and gains in a timely manner to
        shareholders, the Fund generally will not be subject to U.S. federal
        income tax on the income and gains it distributes. To qualify as a RIC,
        among other requirements, a Fund must (1) distribute in each taxable
        year at least 90% of its "investment company taxable income" and 90% of
        its net tax-exempt income, if any (the "Distribution Requirement"); (2)
        derive at least 90% of its gross income each taxable year from certain
        qualifying sources such as dividends, interest, gains from the sale or
        other disposition of stock, securities, or foreign currencies, or income
        derived with respect to its business of investing in such stock,
        securities, or currencies (the "Qualifying Income Requirement"); and (3)
        satisfy certain asset diversification tests at the end of each quarter
        (the "Diversification Requirement").
        <br />
        <br />
        To the extent a Fund invests in instruments that may generate income
        that is not qualifying income (which can include certain derivatives),
        the Fund intends to monitor and limit such investments so that its
        non-qualifying income does not exceed 10% of gross income. If a Fund
        were to fail the Qualifying Income Requirement or the Diversification
        Requirement, relief provisions may be available in limited circumstances
        if the failure is due to reasonable cause and not willful neglect and
        the Fund pays a penalty tax and/or takes corrective action. If relief
        were not available and a Fund failed to qualify for RIC treatment for a
        taxable year, the Fund would be subject to tax at the Fund level on all
        of its taxable income at corporate rates, and distributions from
        earnings and profits (including distributions of net capital gain) would
        be taxable to shareholders as ordinary income. The Fund could be
        required to recognize and distribute earnings and profits as a condition
        to requalifying as a RIC in a subsequent year.
        <br />
        <br />
        A Fund may elect to treat part or all of certain "late-year losses" as
        incurred in the following taxable year for purposes of determining its
        taxable income and distributions. Net capital losses (capital losses in
        excess of capital gains) generally may be carried forward indefinitely
        by a RIC to offset future capital gains, subject to limitations. The
        carryover of losses may be limited following certain ownership changes.
        <br />
        <br />
        Each Fund may be subject to a 4% nondeductible federal excise tax on
        certain undistributed amounts if it does not distribute during each
        calendar year at least (i) 98% of its ordinary income for the calendar
        year and (ii) 98.2% of its capital gain net income for the one-year
        period ending on October 31 (or, if the Fund makes an election, for its
        fiscal year), plus any shortfalls from the prior year. The Funds intend
        to make distributions in amounts and at times intended to minimize
        excise tax, but there can be no assurance that all such liability will
        be eliminated.
        <br />
        <br />
        If a Fund retains net capital gain, it may designate the retained amount
        as "undistributed capital gains" in a notice to shareholders. In that
        case, shareholders would (i) be required to include their share of such
        undistributed amount in income as long-term capital gain, (ii) be
        entitled to a credit for their share of the tax paid by the Fund on such
        undistributed amount, and (iii) increase their tax basis in Shares by
        the excess of the amount included in income over the tax deemed paid.
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>Taxation of shareholders — distributions.</b> Distributions of a
        Fund's "investment company taxable income" (computed without regard to
        the dividends-paid deduction) are taxable to shareholders as ordinary
        income, whether paid in cash or reinvested. Distributions of a Fund's
        net capital gain (net long-term capital gains in excess of net
        short-term capital losses) are taxable as long-term capital gains,
        regardless of how long a shareholder has held Shares. A portion of
        ordinary income dividends paid to non-corporate shareholders may be
        eligible to be taxed at the reduced rates applicable to "qualified
        dividend income" if certain holding period and other requirements are
        met by both the Fund and the shareholder. To the extent properly
        reported, certain dividends received by corporate shareholders may be
        eligible for the dividends-received deduction, subject to holding period
        and other limitations.
        <br />
        <br />
        Distributions are generally taxable when paid; however, any dividend
        declared in October, November, or December with a record date in such
        month and paid in January is treated for U.S. federal income tax
        purposes as received on December 31 of the year declared. Distributions
        may also be subject to state and local taxes.
        <br />
        <br />
        If a Fund's distributions exceed its current and accumulated earnings
        and profits, all or a portion of such excess will be treated as a return
        of capital to shareholders, reducing each shareholder's tax basis in
        Shares (and, after such basis is reduced to zero, resulting in capital
        gain).
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>Taxation of shareholders — sale or exchange of Shares.</b>
        A sale or other taxable disposition of Shares generally will result in a
        capital gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount realized
        and the shareholder's adjusted tax basis in the Shares. The gain or loss
        will be long-term if the Shares were held for more than one year, and
        short-term otherwise. Any loss realized on a disposition of Shares held
        for six months or less will be treated as long-term capital loss to the
        extent of any amounts treated as long-term capital gain that were
        distributed (or deemed distributed) with respect to such Shares. Losses
        may be disallowed under the "wash sale" rules if substantially identical
        Shares are acquired within 30 days before or after the disposition.
        Shareholders should consult their brokers regarding available cost-basis
        reporting methods and elections.
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>Special and Complex Rules Applicable to Derivatives.</b>
        <br />
        The Founder-Led 2x Daily ETF's investments in derivatives are subject to
        special and complex U.S. federal income tax rules that can affect the
        character, timing, and amount of the Fund's income, gains, losses, and
        distributions.
        <br /><br />
        Certain exchange-traded futures and options may be treated as "Section
        1256 contracts" and are required to be marked to market at year end.
        Gains or losses on Section 1256 contracts generally are treated as 60%
        long-term and 40% short-term capital gain or loss, regardless of holding
        period, and may be required to be recognized for tax purposes even if no
        corresponding cash is received.
        <br /><br />
        Payments (or accruals) under swap agreements and other non-Section 1256
        derivatives generally are treated as ordinary income or loss. The
        "straddle," "wash sale," and "constructive sale" rules may defer losses,
        accelerate recognition of gains, or otherwise affect the character of
        the Fund's income and gains. The Fund's use of derivatives could also
        affect whether the Fund has made sufficient distributions to maintain
        its qualification as a regulated investment company and to avoid
        fund-level tax. Shareholders should consult their tax advisers regarding
        how these rules may affect their own tax situation. See Federal Income
        Taxes in this SAI for additional details.
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>Creations and redemptions by Authorized Participants.</b>
        An Authorized Participant that exchanges securities for Creation Units
        generally will recognize gain or loss equal to the difference between
        the market value of the Creation Units at the time and the sum of the
        Authorized Participant's aggregate basis in the securities surrendered
        plus the cash paid, if any. An Authorized Participant that redeems
        Creation Units generally will recognize gain or loss equal to the
        difference between the Authorized Participant's basis in the Creation
        Units and the sum of the aggregate market value of any securities
        received plus the cash received, if any. The Internal Revenue Service
        may take the position that a loss realized upon an exchange of
        securities for Creation Units may be disallowed under the wash sale
        rules (for an exchanger that does not mark-to-market) or on the basis
        that there has been no significant change in economic position. If,
        after a creation, a purchaser (or group) would own 80% or more of a
        Fund's outstanding Shares and Section 351 of the Code otherwise would
        apply, the Fund may reject the order and may require beneficial
        ownership information reasonably necessary to evaluate the application
        of Section 351. If the Fund nonetheless issues Creation Units in such
        circumstances, the Authorized Participant may not recognize gain or loss
        on the exchange. Authorized Participants should consult their own tax
        advisers.
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>Taxation of Fund investments.</b> Certain investments (including,
        without limitation, derivatives, foreign currency contracts, and
        transactions subject to the "straddle," "constructive sale," or
        "mark-to-market" rules) may be subject to complex provisions of the Code
        that, among other things, could affect the character of gains and losses
        realized by a Fund, accelerate the recognition of income to a Fund,
        defer losses, or affect whether income is qualifying income for RIC
        purposes. These rules may also require a Fund to recognize income or
        gains without a corresponding receipt of cash, potentially requiring the
        Fund to sell securities to meet the Distribution Requirement. Each Fund
        intends to monitor transactions, make appropriate elections, and
        maintain books and records as required to mitigate adverse tax
        consequences and preserve RIC status.
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>Backup withholding and reporting.</b> A Fund may be required to
        withhold federal income tax ("backup withholding") from dividends,
        capital gain distributions, and redemption proceeds payable to
        shareholders who fail to provide a correct taxpayer identification
        number, who are subject to backup withholding due to under-reporting,
        who fail to certify that they are not subject to backup withholding, or
        who fail to certify their U.S. status. Backup withholding is not an
        additional tax and amounts withheld may be credited against a
        shareholder's federal income tax liability.
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>Net investment income tax.</b> Certain individuals, trusts, and
        estates are subject to a 3.8% tax on their "net investment income," (the
        "NII tax") which generally includes distributions from a Fund and net
        gains from the sale or other disposition of Shares.
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>Non-U.S. shareholders.</b> Distributions to non-U.S. shareholders
        generally will be subject to U.S. withholding tax at the rate of 30% (or
        a lower applicable treaty rate) to the extent derived from ordinary
        income. Subject to certain requirements, a Fund may report a portion of
        its distributions as "interest-related dividends" or "short-term capital
        gain dividends," which generally are exempt from such withholding for
        non-U.S. shareholders; special rules and exceptions apply, including for
        individuals present in the United States for 183 days or more during the
        year. Gains realized by non-U.S. shareholders on the sale of Shares
        generally are not subject to U.S. federal income tax, subject to certain
        exceptions. Non-U.S. shareholders may be subject to backup withholding
        if they fail to provide required certifications.
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>FATCA.</b> Under the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act ("FATCA"), a
        Fund may be required to withhold 30% on ordinary income distributions
        paid to certain foreign financial institutions and non-financial foreign
        entities that fail to satisfy documentation, reporting, or other
        requirements. FATCA may also affect a Fund's returns on certain
        investments. Investors should consult their tax advisers regarding
        FATCA.
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>Tax-exempt shareholders.</b> Tax-exempt investors (including
        retirement plans and IRAs) are generally exempt from federal income tax
        on Fund distributions and gains, except to the extent that such amounts
        constitute unrelated business taxable income ("UBTI"). In certain
        circumstances, investments by a Fund (for example, in residual interests
        of real estate mortgage investment conduits or certain real estate
        investment trusts) could generate UBTI to tax-exempt shareholders.
        Tax-exempt investors should consult their tax advisers.
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>Certain reporting.</b> Shareholders may be required to file IRS Form
        8886 if they recognize a loss on a disposition of Shares that exceeds
        applicable thresholds. Significant penalties may apply for failure to
        comply with reporting requirements. The fact that a loss is reportable
        does not affect whether the treatment of the loss is proper.
        <br />
        <br />
        The tax information provided here is only a summary of certain
        considerations. Prospective investors should consult their own tax
        advisers regarding the U.S. federal, state, local, and foreign tax
        consequences of an investment in the Funds.

        <h3>Item 30. Indemnification</h3>
        Reference is made to Article IX of the Registrant's Agreement and
        Declaration of Trust. In general, that provision authorizes
        indemnification of Trustees, officers, employees, and agents of the
        Trust for liabilities and expenses arising in connection with their
        service to the Trust, subject to the limitations set forth therein and
        under applicable law.
        <br />
        <br />
        Pursuant to Rule 484 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the
        "Securities Act"), the Registrant furnishes the following undertaking:
        "Insofar as indemnification for liability arising under the Securities
        Act may be permitted to Trustees, officers, and controlling persons of
        the Registrant pursuant to the foregoing provisions, or otherwise, the
        Registrant has been advised that, in the opinion of the Securities and
        Exchange Commission, such indemnification is against public policy as
        expressed in the Securities Act and is therefore unenforceable. If a
        claim for indemnification against such liabilities is made (other than
        reimbursement by the Registrant of expenses incurred or paid by a
        Trustee, officer, or controlling person of the Registrant in the
        successful defense of any action, suit, or proceeding) is asserted by
        such Trustee, officer, or controlling person in connection with the
        securities being registered, the Registrant will, unless its counsel
        determines that the matter has been settled by controlling precedent,
        submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question of whether
        such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the
        Securities Act, and the Registrant will be bound by the court's final
        adjudication of the issue."
