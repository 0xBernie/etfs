    <p>Section 1. Management of the Trust.</p>
    <p>
      The business and affairs of the Trust shall be managed by, or under the
      direction of, the Trustees, who may exercise all powers necessary or
      convenient to carry out the purposes of the Trust in accordance with this
      Declaration, the Delaware Act, the 1940 Act, and other applicable law.
    </p>
    <p>Section 2. Initial Trustees; Election and Number of Trustees.</p>
    <p>
      The individual executing this Declaration shall serve as the initial
      Trustee. Thereafter, the number of Trustees shall be fixed from time to
      time by majority vote of the Trustees, provided that at least one (1)
      Trustee shall always serve. Except as otherwise required by the 1940 Act
      or this Declaration, Trustees shall be elected solely by the Trustees. The
      number of Trustees may be increased or decreased by Board resolution,
      provided that the composition at all times satisfies Section 10 of the
      1940 Act (i.e., at least 40 percent of the Board must be Independent
      Trustees).
    </p>
    <p>Section 3. Term of Office; Resignation and Removal of Trustees.</p>
    <p>
      Each Trustee shall serve during the continued existence of the Trust and
      until the earliest of (a) the Trustee's death, resignation, retirement, or
      removal, or (b) the election and qualification of a successor. A Trustee
      may resign by written notice delivered to the Trust. A Trustee may be
      removed (i) with or without cause, by written instrument signed by at
      least a majority of the other Trustees, or (ii) by the affirmative vote of
      two-thirds (2/3) of the Outstanding Shares entitled to vote, consistent
      with Section 16(c) of the 1940 Act.
    </p>
    <p>Section 4. Vacancies; Appointment of Trustees.</p>
    <p>
      Whenever a vacancy exists in the collective body of Trustees in office
      pursuant to Article II, acting with the authority granted by this
      Declaration; due to death, resignation, removal, retirement, incapacity,
      or any other reason, the remaining Trustees shall, by majority vote,
      appoint a new Trustee to fill such vacancy. The appointment shall be
      effective immediately upon written acceptance by the appointed Trustee or
      at a subsequent date set by the Trustees. Trustees may anticipate future
      vacancies due to retirement, resignation, or otherwise, and appoint
      successor Trustees in advance, provided such appointments become effective
      only upon actual vacancy.
    </p>
    <p>Section 5. Temporary Vacancy or Absence.</p>
    <p>
      During any period when a Trustee is temporarily unable to fulfill their
      duties due to absence, incapacity, or vacancy, the remaining Trustees,
      regardless of their number, shall have full power to manage the Trust's
      affairs. In exercising authority under this Section the remaining Trustees
      may rely in good faith on the advice of counsel, auditors or other
      experts, and such reliance shall be conclusive evidence of reasonable care
      under &sect; 3806(f) of the Delaware Act. In the extraordinary event that
      all Trustees simultaneously become unable to act, officers of the Trust
      shall have authority to appoint interim Trustees to restore proper
      governance as required under Section 16(a) of the 1940 Act.
    </p>
    <p>Section 6. Actions by the Trustees.</p>
    <p>
      Unless otherwise specified herein or in the By-Laws or required by
      applicable law, any action taken by the Trustees shall be valid if
      approved by a majority of Trustees present at a duly convened meeting
      where a quorum is present; a quorum shall consist of more than one-half of
      the number of Trustees then in office unless the By-Laws specify a higher
      percentage, or by written consent of the Trustees in the manner provided
      in the By-Laws. Trustees may meet by electronic or telephonic means if all
      participants can communicate effectively.
    </p>
    <p>Section 7. Ownership of Trust Property.</p>
    <p>
      Legal title to all Trust Property shall be vested exclusively in the
      Trust. The Trustees shall have the power to cause legal title of Trust
      Property to be held in the name of one or more Trustees or other
      designated persons as nominee, provided that beneficial ownership remains
      with the Trust. Upon resignation, death, or removal, a Trustee shall
      automatically cease to have any right, title, or interest in Trust
      Property, and such right, title, or interest shall vest in the remaining
      Trustees without further action.
    </p>
    <p>Section 8. Effect of Trustees Not Serving.</p>
    <p>
      The death, resignation, retirement, removal, incapacity, or refusal of any
      Trustee to serve shall not dissolve or terminate the Trust or revoke any
      action previously authorized by the Board. The authority of remaining
      Trustees shall continue in full effect, and such occurrence shall not
      impair the Trust's ability to continue its business or carry out its
      obligations.
    </p>
    <p>Section 9. Trustees and Officers as Shareholders.</p>
    <p>
      Trustees, officers, employees, or agents of the Trust, including their
      affiliates, may acquire, own, and dispose of Shares to the same extent as
      any other Shareholder, subject to compliance with applicable laws, rules,
      and regulations, including Trust policies on conflicts of interest and
      personal securities transactions.
    </p>
    <p>Section 10. Trustee Compensation.</p>
    <p>
      Each Trustee shall be entitled to such reasonable remuneration for serving
      as a Trustee, and to reimbursement of properly incurred expenses, as the
      Board may determine from time to time. Trustees may fix their own
      compensation from time to time, provided that no compensation shall be
      paid for services that duplicate those paid by any investment adviser or
      other service provider. Trustees compensated under any contract with the
      Trust's Adviser, Sub-Adviser, Distributor or other service provider shall
      not receive duplicative compensation from the Trust. No compensation shall
      accrue for any period after a Trustee's resignation, removal or
      retirement, except as the Board may expressly authorize for emeritus
      service.

    </p>
    <p>ARTICLE IV - SERIES; CLASSES; SHARES</p>
    <p>Section 1. Establishment of Series and Classes.</p>
    <p>
      The Trust shall comprise one or more Series, each constituting a separate
      portfolio of assets and liabilities, as the Trustees may establish by
      written resolution incorporated herein by reference. The Trustees may
      create additional Series or classes of Shares, merge or terminate existing
      Series or classes, or redesignate any Series or class, all without
      Shareholder approval except to the extent required by the 1940 Act.
    </p>
    <p>
      (a) Shares of a given Series represent proportionate, undivided beneficial
      interests only in the assets allocated to that Series. Except as the
      Trustees may expressly provide, all Shares of a Series (or of a class
      within that Series) shall be identical; however, the Trustees may allocate
      expenses, fees, voting rights, distribution policies, redemption fees, or
      other preferences exclusively to a particular class.
    </p>
    <p>
      (b) The Series and classes listed on Schedule A are hereby designated the
      "Initial Series and Classes." Schedule A may be updated by the Trustees
      from time to time to reflect the creation, combination, or termination of
      any Series or class, and such changes shall become effective upon the
      Trustees' adoption of the relevant resolution without further action by
      the Shareholders; each update to Schedule A shall identify the adoption
      date so that regulatory filings may trace Series creation to the
      corresponding Board action.
    </p>
    <p>Section 2. Shares.</p>
    <p>
      (a) The beneficial interest in each Series is divided into an unlimited
      number of Shares of one or more Classes, all without par value and fully
      paid and non-assessable; and unless otherwise resolved by the Trustees the
      Shares shall be uncertificated and book-entry only The Trustees may,
      without Shareholder approval, issue, reissue, sell, or otherwise dispose
      of Shares (including fractional Shares), divide or combine Shares,
      classify or re-classify unissued Shares, and take any other action they
      deem advisable with respect to the Shares.
    </p>
    <p>
      (b) Except as otherwise provided for distinct Classes, each Share of a
      Series represents an equal, undivided beneficial interest in the net
      assets of that Series and entitles the holder to a proportionate share of
      all dividends and other distributions. Upon redemption, the Shareholder is
      paid solely from the assets of the applicable Series.
    </p>
    <p>
      (c) The Trust or its transfer agent shall maintain definitive records of
      Share ownership. Certificates need not be issued unless the Trustees
      determine otherwise. Each Shareholder, on request, must furnish
      information the Trustees deem necessary to comply with the Internal
      Revenue Code, other tax laws, or applicable regulations.
    </p>
    <p>Section 3. Pre-emptive, Appraisal and Contract Rights.</p>
    <p>
      No Shareholder has any preference, pre-emptive, appraisal, or similar
      right to acquire any Shares or other securities of the Trust or a Series,
      except to the extent expressly granted by the Trustees. No Shareholder
      shall have any appraisal rights with respect to its Shares, to the maximum
      extent permitted by the Delaware Act. The Trust's public filings do not
      create contractual rights between the Trust (or any Series) and its
      Shareholders.
    </p>
    <p>Section 4. Investments in the Trust.</p>
    <p>
      The Trustees may accept investments in any Series from any person, at such
      times, for such consideration (cash or securities permissible for that
      Series), and on such terms as they deem appropriate. Investments are
      credited at the next calculated Net Asset Value per Share unless the
      Trustees fix another value for initial capital. For each ETF Series the
      Trustees may require that purchases and redemptions be effected only in
      Creation Units; references herein to 'redemptions' shall include the
      redemption of Creation Units unless the context otherwise requires. The
      Trustees may refuse any investment at any time for any reason.
    </p>
    <p>Section 5. Tax Status Elections.</p>
    <p>
      The Trustees may, in their discretion and without Shareholder approval,
      cause the Trust or any Series to elect or terminate any tax classification
      or treatment (including, without limitation, status under Subchapter M of
      the Code) that the Trustees determine to be in the best interests of the
      Trust or the affected Series.
    </p>
    <p>Section 6. Assets and Liabilities of Series and Classes.</p>
    <p>
      All consideration received for Shares of a Series, together with all
      income, earnings, profits, and proceeds thereof, are irrevocably allocated
      to that Series. Notice of the series limitation on liabilities shall be
      printed, if certificates are ever issued, on the face or reverse of each
      certificate in accordance with &sect; 3804(c) of the Delaware Act.
      Liabilities incurred by a particular Series or Class shall be enforceable
      only against the assets of that Series or Class, and no other Series or
      Class shall be liable therefor.
    </p>
    <p>Section 7. Ownership and Transfer of Shares</p>
    <p>
      (a) Record of Ownership. Ownership of every Share, classified by Series
      and Class, shall be recorded on the books of the Trust or its duly
      appointed transfer agent. Separate ledgers shall be maintained for each
      Series and Class.
    </p>
    <p>
      (b) Certificates. Shares shall be uncertificated unless the Trustees
      authorize certificates and prescribe their form and safeguards.
    </p>
    <p>
      (c) Transfers. A Share is transferable only upon presentation of proper
      instructions (and any certificate, if issued) to the Trust or its transfer
      agent, together with evidence of authority the Trustees may reasonably
      require. The transferee shall be registered promptly, and until such
      registration the transferor remains the Shareholder of record for all
      purposes.
    </p>
    <p>
      (d) Legal Representatives. Persons acquiring Shares by operation of law
      (e.g., death or bankruptcy) shall be registered upon proof satisfactory to
      the Trust; until then, the prior holder remains the Shareholder of record.
    </p>
    <p>
      (e) Regulatory or Tax Restrictions. To preserve the Trust's status under
      the Code and the 1940 Act, the Trustees may refuse to issue or transfer,
      or may compel redemption of, Shares that would result in a concentration
      or other condition contrary to such status.
    </p>
    <p>
      (f) Shareholder Information. The Trustees may require each Shareholder to
      furnish an address and any additional information necessary for compliance
      with applicable law or Trust policies. No distribution or notice need be
      made until such information is provided.
    </p>
    <p>Section 8. Status of Shares; Limitation of Shareholder Liability</p>
    <p>
      (a) Personal Property. Each Share constitutes personal property conferring
      only the rights expressly set forth in this Declaration and the By-Laws.
      Share ownership does not give any right to specific Trust or Series
      property, to partition, or to an accounting.
    </p>
    <p>
      (b) No Personal Liability. Shareholders shall not be personally liable for
      any debt, obligation, or liability of the Trust, a Series, or a Class, and
      no creditor may look beyond the assets allocated to the relevant Series or
      Class for satisfaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      (c) Assent to Terms. By acquiring Shares, every Shareholder agrees to be
      bound by this Declaration and the By-Laws. The death, incapacity, or
      bankruptcy of a Shareholder does not affect the Trust or entitle any
      representative to an accounting beyond the rights afforded herein.
    </p>
    <p>
      (d) Notice of Disclaimer. The Trustees may cause any instrument executed
      on behalf of the Trust or a Series to state that such instrument is
      executed by a trustee or officer in that capacity only and not
      individually, and that liability is limited to Trust or Series assets.
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 9. Dividends, Distributions and Redemptions. No dividend,
      distribution or redemption may be effected except from assets properly
      allocable to the relevant Series or Class. The Trustees, in their sole
      discretion, determine what constitutes income or capital and may delegate
      the authority to declare and set the terms of any dividend or
      distribution.
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 10. Fractions. Fractional Shares carry proportionate voting rights
      and entitlements to dividends, distributions and redemptions identical to
      those of whole Shares.
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 11. Exchange Privilege. The Trustees may establish procedures
      allowing Shareholders to exchange Shares of one Series or Class for Shares
      of another Series or Class (or for interests in an affiliated investment
      vehicle) on such terms as they may prescribe, subject to the 1940 Act.
    </p>
    <p>ARTICLE V - DISTRIBUTIONS, REDEMPTIONS AND NET ASSET VALUE</p>
    <p>Section 1. Distributions.</p>
    <p>
      (a) The Trustees may from time to time declare and pay cash or in-kind
      dividends or other distributions from the income, capital gains or other
      assets of the Trust or of any Series, in such amounts, at such intervals
      and on such record, declaration and payment dates as they deem prudent.
    </p>
    <p>
      (b) Except as otherwise provided for a particular Series or Class, each
      distribution shall be allocated pro rata among Outstanding Shares of the
      relevant Series in proportion to the number of such Shares held on the
      applicable record date; Class-specific distributions shall be allocated
      solely among Shares of that Class.
    </p>
    <p>
      (c) The Trustees may adopt, modify or terminate dividend-reinvestment,
      cash-dividend or similar programs and may make distributions in additional
      Shares to any extent permitted by law.
    </p>
    <p>Section 2. Redemptions.</p>
    <p>
      (a) Unless the Trustees have limited redemptions to Creation Units, any
      Shareholder may, on any Business Day, require the Trust to redeem all or
      part of the Shareholder's Shares of a Series at the Net Asset Value per
      Share next computed after receipt of a properly completed redemption
      request, less any redemption fee or other charge duly established by the
      Trustees.
    </p>
    <p>
      (b) Redemption proceeds may be paid wholly in cash, wholly in securities,
      or partly in each, as the Trustees consider fair to remaining
      Shareholders. Payment shall be made within the period required by the 1940
      Act; however, the Trustees may postpone payment or suspend the right of
      redemption to the extent permitted by that Act.
    </p>
    <p>
      (c) For any Series whose Shares are redeemable only in Creation Units, an
      order to redeem less than one Creation Unit may, in the Trustees'
      discretion, be rejected or deferred until aggregate requests equal at
      least one full Creation Unit.
    </p>
    <p>
      (d) The Trust may retain from redemption proceeds any amount owed by the
      redeeming Shareholder to the Trust, any Series or Class.
    </p>
    <p>Section 3. Redemption by the Trust.</p>
    <p>
      The Trustees may direct the compulsory redemption of Shares at the price
      that would apply to a voluntary redemption if they determine that (i)
      continued ownership could violate law or jeopardize the Trust's or a
      Series' status under the Code or the 1940 Act; (ii) the Shareholder has
      failed to satisfy identification, minimum-investment or other
      requirements; or (iii) such action is otherwise in the best interests of
      the Trust or the affected Series or Class.
    </p>
    <p>Section 4. Sale of Shares at the Trust's Option.</p>
    <p>
      If Shares remain unclaimed or uncertificated in an account for a period
      designated by the Trustees and the Shareholder fails to respond to
      reasonable outreach, the Trustees may authorize the sale of those Shares
      for the Shareholder's account; after deducting reasonable expenses, the
      net proceeds shall be remitted to the Shareholder's address of record, and
      all further rights in the sold Shares shall terminate.
    </p>
    <p>Section 5. Prevention of Personal Holding Company Status.</p>
    <p>
      To avoid classification as a "personal holding company" under Subchapter G
      of the Code, the Trustees may reject any purchase order, decline to
      register any transfer, or require the compulsory redemption of Shares, all
      as they deem necessary or advisable.
    </p>
    <p>Section 6. Determination of Net Asset Value per Share.</p>
    <p>
      (a) "Net Asset Value per Share" ("NAV") of each Series and Class shall be
      determined in accordance with valuation procedures adopted by the Trustees
      and disclosed in the Trust's registration statement
    </p>
    <p>
      (b) Unless the Trustees determine otherwise, NAV shall be computed as of
      the close of regular trading on the principal exchange for the Series on
      each Business Day that such exchange is open, and at such additional times
      as the Trustees may designate.
    </p>
    <p>
      (c) If Shares have been issued or redeemed at an NAV later determined to
      be erroneous, the Trustees may, in their discretion and in accordance with
      Commission guidance, authorize equitable adjustments or re-processing of
      those transactions.
    </p>
    <p>Section 7. Suspension of Redemption Rights.</p>
    <p>
      The right of redemption may be suspended, or the date of payment
      postponed, only:
    </p>
    <p>
      (i) for any period during which the New York Stock Exchange is closed
      (other than customary weekend and holiday closings) or trading thereon is
      restricted;
    </p>
    <p>
      (ii) for any period during which an emergency exists as a result of which
      disposal of the securities owned by the Trust or any Series is not
      reasonably practicable, or it is not reasonably practicable for the Trust
      or any Series fairly to determine the Net Asset Value of its Shares;
    </p>
    <p>
      (iii) for any other period as the Commission may by order permit for the
      protection of Shareholders; or
    </p>
    <p>
      (iv) as otherwise permitted by Section 22(e) of the 1940 Act and the rules
      thereunder.
    </p>
    <p>
      For any Series whose Shares are redeemable only in Creation Units, any
      such suspension shall apply to Creation-Unit redemptions.
    </p>
    <p>ARTICLE VI - SHAREHOLDERS' POWERS AND MEETINGS</p>
    <p>Section 1. Voting Powers.</p>
    <p>
      (a) Shareholders may vote only (i) on matters required by this
      Declaration, the By-Laws, the 1940 Act, the Delaware Act, or other
      applicable law, and (ii) on such additional matters as the Trustees
      expressly submit to Shareholder vote.
    </p>
    <p>
      (b) Except as otherwise provided, each Share confers one vote (or, if the
      Trustees so resolve, one vote for each dollar of NAV) on every matter for
      which the Share is entitled to vote.
    </p>
    <p>
      (c) All Shares vote together in the aggregate unless the Trustees
      determine, or the 1940 Act requires, that a matter affects only particular
      Series or Classes, in which case the affected Series or Classes vote
      separately.
    </p>
    <p>
      (d) Voting is non-cumulative. Until Shares of a Series or Class are
      outstanding, the Trustees may exercise all Shareholder rights for that
      Series or Class. Treasury Shares carry no voting rights.
    </p>
    <p>Section 2. Meetings of Shareholders.</p>
    <p>
      (a) Annual and special meetings shall be called, noticed and conducted as
      provided in the By-Laws or as the Trustees otherwise determine.
    </p>
    <p>
      (b) A quorum consists of Shareholders representing one-third (33 ⅓ %) of
      Outstanding Shares entitled to vote (applied Series- or Class-by-Series
      when voting separately).
    </p>
    <p>
      (c) Unless a greater vote is required, a majority of Shares voted decides
      any matter; a plurality of Shares voted elects a Trustee.
    </p>
    <p>
      (d) Any Shareholder meeting may be adjourned or postponed by the chair to
      any time or place without further notice if announced at the meeting,
      unless a new record date is fixed or the adjournment exceeds ninety (90)
      days.
    </p>
    <p>
      (e) Unless otherwise required by the 1940 Act, any action that may be
      taken at a meeting of Shareholders may be taken without a meeting by the
      written consent of the holders of the number (or proportion) of Shares
      that would be necessary to approve the matter at a meeting, subject to
      such procedures as the Trustees may establish.
    </p>
    <p>Section 3. Inspection of Records.</p>
    <p>
      To the fullest extent permitted by law, Shareholders have no right to
      inspect Trust or Series books or records, except as expressly required by
      the Delaware Act or authorized by the Trustees; upon written request the
      Trust will furnish copies of its Certificate of Trust, this Declaration,
      the By-Laws and publicly available tax information.
    </p>
    <p>Section 4. Derivative and Direct Actions.</p>
    <p>
      (a)This Section is intended to enable bona-fide Shareholder claims while
      protecting the Trust and its Shareholders from meritless or duplicative
      litigation.
    </p>
    <p>
      (b) A Shareholder (together with any co-plaintiffs) must have continuously
      owned-both at the time of the alleged wrong and throughout the
      litigation-at least ten percent (10 %) of the Outstanding Shares of each
      Series or Class that would be affected by the proposed action.
    </p>
    <p>
      (c) Before filing suit the Shareholder must deliver to the Board a written
      demand stating with reasonable particularity (i) the alleged breach or
      wrong, (ii) the relief sought and (iii) the basis for the Shareholder's
      standing. The Trustees, or a committee of independent Trustees, shall have
      not less than ninety (90) days to investigate the matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      (d) If a majority of the independent Trustees, after such investigation,
      determine in good faith that the requested action is not in the best
      interests of the Trust or the affected Series or Class, that decision is
      binding unless the plaintiff proves that the Trustees failed to satisfy
      the standard of conduct in Article X, Section 2.
    </p>
    <p>
      (e) A Shareholder may assert a direct claim only for an injury distinct
      from the injury suffered by Shareholders generally; claims that affect
      Shareholders proportionally must be brought derivatively under this
      Section.
    </p>
    <p>
      (f) If a derivative or direct action is dismissed for failure to comply
      with this Section, the court may require the plaintiff Shareholder(s) to
      reimburse the Trust, Series or Class for its reasonable expenses,
      including attorneys' fees.
    </p>
    <p>ARTICLE VII - CONTRACTS WITH SERVICE PROVIDERS</p>
    <p>Section 1. Investment Adviser.</p>
    <p>
      (a) The Trustees may, on behalf of the Trust or any Series, enter into one
      or more investment-advisery or management agreements for such compensation
      and on such terms as they deem reasonable, providing for portfolio
      management, research, voting of proxies and related services.
    </p>
    <p>
      (b) Each agreement may authorize the Adviser, subject to Board oversight,
      to delegate duties to one or more qualified sub-advisers. Every Adviser
      and sub-adviser must be registered or exempt under the Investment Advisers
      Act of 1940 and shall act as a fiduciary to the Trust.
    </p>
    <p>
      (c) Every advisory contract shall comply with Section 15 of the 1940 Act,
      including requirements for initial approval, annual renewal, assignment
      and termination without penalty on sixty (60) days' written notice.
    </p>
    <p>Section 2. Principal Underwriter / Distributor.</p>
    <p>
      (a) The Trustees may appoint one or more Persons as exclusive or
      non-exclusive principal underwriter, distributor or marketing agent for
      any Series, and may enter into distribution agreements permitting issuance
      and sale of Shares directly, through selling agents, or pursuant to dealer
      arrangements.
    </p>
    <p>
      (b) The Trustees may adopt and administer plans of distribution under Rule
      12b-1 or any successor rule and may finance distribution-related expenses
      from Trust or Series assets to the extent permitted by law.
    </p>
    <p>Section 3. Custodian.</p>
    <p>
      (a) All portfolio securities and similar investments of the Trust and each
      Series shall be placed and maintained with a custodian meeting the
      requirements of Section 17(f) of the 1940 Act pursuant to a written
      contract approved by the Trustees.
    </p>
    <p>
      (b) A custodian agreement may authorize the custodian to (i) hold, settle,
      deliver and receive assets; (ii) collect income; (iii) disburse cash; (iv)
      keep appropriate books and accounts; and (v) employ sub-custodians,
      including foreign sub-custodians, as permitted by applicable rules.
    </p>
    <p>Section 4. Transfer Agency, Shareholder Services and Administration.</p>
    <p>
      The Trustees may retain one or more transfer agents, index-receipt agents,
      administrators, fund accountants, shareholder-servicing agents,
      market-making agents or other service providers, and may allocate such
      functions among multiple parties on terms they find appropriate.
    </p>
    <p>Section 5. Parties to Contracts with Service Providers.</p>
    <p>
      No contract authorized by this Article shall be invalid or voidable
      because any Trustee, officer or Shareholder is an officer, director,
      partner, shareholder or affiliate of, or has another relationship with,
      the counter-party, provided that the contract is approved in accordance
      with the 1940 Act and other applicable law. Persons having such
      relationships may be counted for quorum and may vote on the approval of
      the contract.
    </p>
    <p>Section 6. Modification, Amendment and Waiver.</p>
    <p>
      (a) The Trustees may modify, amend, supplement, assign, novate, extend,
      waive or terminate any contract described in this Article without
      Shareholder approval except to the extent required by the 1940 Act.
    </p>
    <p>
      (b) The enumeration of contracts in this Article VII does not limit the
      Trustees' authority to engage any other service providers or enter into
      additional agreements they deem advisable in furtherance of the Trust's
      purposes.
    </p>
    <p>ARTICLE VIII - EXPENSES OF THE TRUST, SERIES AND CLASSES</p>
    <p>Section 1. General Authority to Pay and Allocate Expenses.</p>
    <p>
      (a) The Trustees may incur, pay or cause to be paid out of the assets or
      income of the Trust, or of any particular Series or Class, all expenses,
      fees, charges, taxes and liabilities that arise in connection with the
      organization, operation or management of the Trust or such Series or
      Class, and may decide what portion shall be paid from principal and what
      portion from income.
    </p>
    <p>
      (b) Without limiting subsection (a), permissible expenses include
      interest, taxes, brokerage commissions, portfolio pricing services,
      custodian and transfer-agency charges, insurance premiums, compensation of
      Trustees, officers, employees and agents, legal and auditing fees,
      registration and filing fees, prospectus and report production and mailing
      costs, shareholder-meeting and proxy expenses, office supplies,
      data-processing, telecommunications, trade-association dues, and all
      extraordinary or non-recurring items such as litigation costs or
      indemnification payments.
    </p>
    <p>
      (c) Expenses that are readily identifiable with a particular Series; or,
      if so designated by the Trustees, with a particular Class, shall be
      charged solely against the assets of that Series or Class. General Trust
      expenses may be allocated among Series or Classes in any fair and
      equitable manner determined by the Trustees, and each such allocation is
      conclusive and binding on all Shareholders.
    </p>
    <p>
      (d) The Trustees shall have a first lien on the assets of each Series (or,
      where applicable, each Class) for the reimbursement of any expense,
      disbursement, loss or liability that has been properly charged to that
      Series or Class.
    </p>
    <p>
      (e) The Trustees may, whenever they deem it equitable, require
      Shareholders (or Shareholders of a particular Series or Class) to pay
      directly, in advance or arrears, fees or charges attributable to their
      accounts; such amounts may be collected by (i) withholding declared but
      unpaid dividends or distributions; or (ii) redeeming or reducing the
      number of full or fractional Shares held in the relevant account to the
      extent necessary to satisfy the obligation.
    </p>
    <p>
      (f) Nothing in this Article precludes the Trust from paying any expense
      directly, nor limits the Trustees' discretion to waive, reimburse or
      recoup expenses as permitted under the 1940 Act and applicable tax
      regulations.
    </p>
    <p>ARTICLE IX - LIMITATION OF LIABILITY AND INDEMNIFICATION</p>
    <p>Section 1. Limitation of Liability.</p>
    <p>
      (a) All Persons contracting with, or asserting any claim against, the
      Trust or a particular Series must look solely to the assets of the Trust
      or that Series for satisfaction; no Trustee, officer, employee or
      Shareholder shall be personally liable therefor.
    </p>
    <p>
      (b) To the fullest extent permitted by law, no Covered Person is liable to
      the Trust, any Series or any Shareholder for any act or omission, unless
      liability results from willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence,
      or reckless disregard of duties.
    </p>
    <p>
      (c) Every note, contract or other instrument may state that it is executed
      by a Trustee or officer in such capacity only and not individually and
      that no personal liability attaches; omission of such statement does not
      negate this Section.
    </p>
    <p>
      (d) No amendment or repeal of this Section shall retroactively impair the
      protection afforded with respect to actions taken prior to the date of
      such amendment or repeal.
    </p>
    <p>Section 2. Indemnification.</p>
    <p>
      (a) The Trust shall indemnify each Covered Person against all liabilities
      and reasonable expenses incurred by reason of being or having been a
      Covered Person, and shall advance expenses prior to final disposition upon
      receipt of a customary undertaking to repay if indemnification is
      ultimately denied.
    </p>
    <p>
      (b) No indemnification shall be provided where a Covered Person is finally
      adjudicated, or, in a settlement, determined, to have engaged in willful
      misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence or reckless disregard of duty.
    </p>
    <p>
      (c) Indemnification rights are non-exclusive, may be insured against, and
      inure to the benefit of heirs and personal representatives.
    </p>
    <p>
      (d) Any determination as to a Covered Person's entitlement to
      indemnification shall afford that person a rebuttable presumption that the
      applicable standard of conduct was met.
    </p>
    <p>
      (e) Reasonable expenses incurred in a proceeding shall be advanced by the
      Trust or relevant Series upon execution of an undertaking; such
      advancement shall not be deemed a "loan."
    </p>
    <p>
      (f) Liabilities and expenses subject to indemnification are joint and
      several obligations of the Trust and all Series, but may be allocated
      among Series or Classes in any fair and equitable manner determined by the
      Trustees.
    </p>
    <p>
      (g) Repeal or modification of this Article applies only prospectively and
      shall not diminish any Covered Person's rights with respect to prior acts.
    </p>
    <p>
      (h) Nothing herein prevents the Trust from granting indemnification or
      advancement rights by contract or otherwise, including in connection with
      a merger, acquisition or similar transaction.
    </p>
    <p>Section 3. Indemnification of Shareholders.</p>
    <p>
      If a Shareholder (or former Shareholder) is held personally liable solely
      by reason of holding Shares and not because of that Shareholder's acts or
      omissions, the Trust (or the affected Series) shall indemnify and hold
      such Shareholder harmless from all loss and expense and, upon request,
      assume the defence and satisfy any judgment out of Trust Property or the
      assets belonging to the relevant Series.
    </p>
    <p>ARTICLE X - MISCELLANEOUS</p>
    <p>Section 1. Statutory Trust; No Partnership.</p>
    <p>
      (a) This Declaration creates a Delaware statutory trust and nothing herein
      shall be construed to form a partnership, joint venture, corporation or
      any similar association.
    </p>
    <p>
      (b) No Trustee, officer or Shareholder may bind any other Trustee, officer
      or Shareholder personally, and Shareholders shall not be deemed partners
      with the Trustees or with one another.
    </p>
    <p>Section 2. Trustee Action; Expert Advice; No Bond or Surety.</p>
    <p>
      (a) Actions, decisions or omissions of the Trustees taken in good faith
      and with the care that an ordinarily prudent person in a like position
      would exercise under similar circumstances are binding on the Trust, its
      Series and all parties in interest. A Trustee is personally liable only
      for the consequences of the Trustee's own willful misconduct, bad faith or
      gross negligence.
    </p>
    <p>
      (b) In discharging their duties the Trustees may rely in good-faith on the
      Trust's books and records and on information, reports, statements or
      opinions of officers, employees, counsel, accountants or other advisers
      chosen with reasonable care; such reliance conclusively evidences due
      care.
    </p>
    <p>
      (c) No Trustee shall be required to furnish a bond, surety or other
      security in connection with service as a Trustee.
    </p>
    <p>Section 3. Insurance.</p>
    <p>
      The Trustees may purchase and maintain, with Trust or Series assets,
      insurance covering any liability or expense of the Trust or of a Covered
      Person arising out of that Person's service to or on behalf of the Trust,
      to the fullest extent permitted by law.
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 4. Termination, Reorganization or Conversion of the Trust or Any
      Series.
    </p>
    <p>
      (a) The Trust and each Series shall exist perpetually unless the Trustees
      determine otherwise.
    </p>
    <p>
      (b) Without Shareholder approval, the Trustees may: (i) sell or liquidate
      all or substantially all assets of the Trust, a Series or Class; (ii)
      merge, consolidate or combine the Trust or any Series or Class with or
      into another entity; (iii) reorganize the Trust or any Series under any
      other form or jurisdiction; (iv) exchange or convert Shares into interests
      of another investment company or entity; or (v) take any other action they
      deem appropriate to wind up, reorganize, merge or convert the Trust, a
      Series or a Class.
    </p>
    <p>
      (c) Upon deciding to dissolve the Trust or any Series, the Trustees shall
      give reasonable notice to affected Shareholders and, after paying or
      making reasonable provision for liabilities, distribute the remaining
      assets in cash or in kind.
    </p>
    <p>Section 5. Amendments.</p>
    <p>
      (a) The Trustees may amend, supplement or restate this Declaration at any
      time without Shareholder approval except where the 1940 Act requires a
      Shareholder vote.
    </p>
    <p>
      (b) No amendment may retroactively curtail the exculpation,
      indemnification or insurance rights of any Person with respect to acts or
      omissions that occurred before the amendment became effective.
    </p>
    <p>Section 6. Records; Headings; Counterparts.</p>
    <p>
      (a) The original or a certified copy of this Declaration and every
      amendment shall be kept at the Trust's principal office and made available
      for inspection as required by law.
    </p>
    <p>
      (b) Headings are for convenience only and shall not affect interpretation.
    </p>
    <p>
      (c) This Declaration may be executed in any number of counterparts, each
      deemed an original.
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 7. Governing Law; Exclusive Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial.
    </p>
    <p>
      (a) This Declaration and all internal affairs of the Trust and its Series
      are governed by the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to
      Delaware conflict-of-laws principles.
    </p>
    <p>
      (b) Any civil action or proceeding arising out of or relating to the
      Trust, a Series, this Declaration or the rights of Shareholders shall be
      brought exclusively in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or,
      if that court lacks subject-matter jurisdiction, another state or federal
      court located in Delaware). Each Shareholder, Trustee, officer and other
      person dealing with the Trust irrevocably submits to the personal
      jurisdiction of, and waives any objection to venue in, those courts.
    </p>
    <p>
      (c) To the fullest extent permitted by law, each such person knowingly,
      voluntarily and irrevocably waives the right to trial by jury in any
      proceeding covered by paragraph (b).
    </p>
    <p>Section 8. Fiscal Year.</p>
    <p>
      The fiscal year of the Trust and each Series shall be fixed, and may be
      changed, by resolution of the Trustees.
    </p>
    <p>Section 9. Severability.</p>
    <p>
      Any provision held inconsistent with the Delaware Act, the 1940 Act or
      other applicable law shall be deemed never to have constituted a part of
      this Declaration, and the remaining provisions shall continue in full
      force and effect.
    </p>
    <p>Section 10. Interpretation.</p>
    <p>
      Unless the context otherwise requires, the singular includes the plural
      and pronouns include all genders; references such as "herein" and "hereof"
      refer to this Declaration as amended from time to time.
    </p>
    <p>Section 11. Reliance by Third Parties.</p>
    <p>
      No person who deals with the Trust, any Series or the Trustees shall be
      obligated to look behind any act of the Trustees or to inquire into the
      validity or propriety of that act. The receipt or acquittance of the
      Trustees or of any officer authorized by the Trustees shall constitute a
      full discharge to such person for all money or property transferred to the
      Trustees or on their order.<br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the undersigned, being the sole initial Trustee of

    <p><u>/s/ Henry B. Margulies</u></p>
    <p>Henry B. Margulies, as Initial Trustee and not individually</p>
    <p><br /></p>
