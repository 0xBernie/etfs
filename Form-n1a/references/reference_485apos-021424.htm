                  exposed to greater risk than other types of securities, such
                  as preferred stock and debt obligations, because common
                  stockholders generally have inferior rights to receive payment
                  from specific issuers. The equity securities held in the

                  value or long periods of decline in value. This may occur

                  factors affecting specific issuers, industries, or sectors in

                          companies may face intense competition, both
                          domestically and internationally, and such competition
                          may have an adverse effect on their profit margins.

                          Semiconductor companies� supply chain and operations
                          are dependent on the availability of materials that
                          meet exacting standards and the use of third parties
                          to provide components and services. Semiconductor
                          companies may rely on a limited number of suppliers,
                          or upon suppliers in a single location, for certain
                          materials, equipment or tools. Finding and qualifying
                          alternate or additional suppliers can be a lengthy
                          process that can cause production delays or impose
                          unforeseen costs, and such alternatives may not be
                          available at all. Production can be disrupted by the
                          unavailability of resources, such as water, silicon,
                          electricity, gases and other materials. Suppliers may
                          also increase prices or encounter cybersecurity or
                          other issues that can disrupt production or increase

                          >The products of semiconductor companies may face
                          obsolescence due to rapid technological developments
                          and frequent new product introduction, unpredictable
                          changes in growth rates and competition for the
                          services of qualified personnel. Capital equipment
                          expenditures could be substantial, and equipment
                          generally suffers from rapid obsolescence. Companies
                          in the semiconductor industry are heavily dependent on
                          patent and intellectual property rights. The loss or
                          impairment of these rights would adversely affect the
                          profitability of these companies.</font

                        ><i>Costs of Buying or Selling Shares. </i>Investors
                        buying or selling Shares in the secondary market will
                        pay brokerage commissions or other charges imposed by
                        brokers, as determined by that broker. Brokerage
                        commissions are often a fixed amount and may be a
                        significant proportional cost for investors seeking to
                        buy or sell relatively small amounts of Shares. In
                        addition, secondary market investors will also incur the
                        cost of the bid-ask spread. The bid-ask spread varies
                        over time for Shares based on trading volume and market
                        liquidity, and is generally lower if Shares have more
                        trading volume and market liquidity and higher if Shares
                        have little trading volume and market liquidity.
                        Further, a relatively small investor base in the Fund,
                        asset swings in the Fund and/or increased market
                        volatility may cause increased bid-ask spreads. Due to
                        the costs of buying or selling Shares, including bid-ask
                        spreads, frequent trading of Shares may significantly
                        reduce investment results and an investment in Shares
                        may not be advisable for investors who anticipate
                        regularly making small investments.</font

                        with all ETFs, Shares may be bought and sold in the

                        expected that the market price of Shares will
                        approximate the Fund�s NAV, there may be times when the
                        market price of Shares is more than the NAV intra-day
                        (premium) or less than the NAV intra-day (discount) due
                        to supply and demand of Shares or during periods of
                        market volatility. This risk is heightened in times of

                        periods when there is limited trading activity for

                  financial intermediary (such as a bank) (an �Intermediary�),

                  participation in activities that are designed to make
                  Intermediaries more knowledgeable about exchange-traded

                  marketing, educational training, or other initiatives related
                  to the sale or promotion of Shares. These payments may create
                  a conflict of interest by influencing the Intermediary and

                  investment. Any such arrangements do not result in increased

                  unaffiliated sub-advisers without obtaining shareholder

                  approval. Shareholders will be notified of any unaffiliated
                  sub-adviser changes. The Adviser has the ultimate
                  responsibility, subject to oversight by the Board, to oversee
                  a sub-adviser and recommend their hiring, termination and
                  replacement. The exemptive relief applies to sub-advisers that

                        ><i>Costs of Buying or Selling Shares. </i>Investors
                        buying or selling Shares in the secondary market will
                        pay brokerage commissions or other charges imposed by
                        brokers, as determined by that broker. Brokerage
                        commissions are often a fixed amount and may be a
                        significant proportional cost for investors seeking to
                        buy or sell relatively small amounts of Shares. In
                        addition, secondary market investors will also incur the
                        cost of the bid-ask spread. The bid-ask spread varies
                        over time for Shares based on trading volume and market
                        liquidity, and is generally lower if Shares have more
                        trading volume and market liquidity and higher if Shares
                        have little trading volume and market liquidity.
                        Further, a relatively small investor base in the Fund,
                        asset swings in the Fund and/or increased market
                        volatility may cause increased bid-ask spreads. Due to
                        the costs of buying or selling Shares, including bid-ask
                        spreads, frequent trading of Shares may significantly
                        reduce investment results and an investment in Shares
                        may not be advisable for investors who anticipate
                        regularly making small investments.</font

                        to supply and demand of Shares or during periods of

                  ><b>General Market Risk.</b> Economies and financial markets
                  throughout the world are becoming increasingly interconnected,
                  which increases the likelihood that events or conditions in
                  one country or region will adversely impact markets or issuers
                  in other countries or regions. Investments in the Fund�s
                  portfolio may underperform in comparison to investments in the
                  general financial markets, a particular financial market or
                  other asset classes, due to a number of factors, including
                  inflation (or expectations for inflation), interest rates,
                  global demand for particular products or resources, natural
                  disasters or events, pandemic diseases, terrorism, regulatory
                  events, and government controls.</font

                  fluctuations and the risks inherent in investment in
                  securities and other financial instruments. Investment markets
                  can be volatile and prices of investments can change

                  limited to, economic growth or recession, changes in interest
                  rates, inflation (or expectations of inflation), deflation (or

                  barriers, regulatory events, other governmental trade or

                  addition, the value of the Fund�s investments may be
                  negatively affected by the occurrence of global events such as
                  war, terrorism, environmental disasters, natural disasters or
                  events, country instability, and infectious disease epidemics
                  or pandemics.. Conflict, loss of life and disaster connected
                  to ongoing armed conflict between Ukraine and Russia in Europe
                  and between Israel and Hamas in the Middle East could have
                  severe adverse effects on the related region, including
                  significant adverse effects on the regional or global
                  economies and the markets for certain securities. The U.S. and
                  the European Union have imposed sanctions on certain Russian
                  individuals and companies, including certain financial
                  institutions, and have limited certain exports and imports to
                  and from Russia. These conflicts have contributed to recent
                  market volatility and may continue to do so.</font

                  from various operational factors, including, but not limited
                  to, human error, processing and communication errors, errors
                  of the Fund�s service providers, counterparties or other
                  third-parties, failed or inadequate processes and technology
                  or systems failures. The Fund relies on third-parties for a
                  range of services, including custody. Any delay or failure
                  relating to engaging or maintaining such service providers may
                  affect the Fund�s ability to meet its investment objective.
                  Although the Fund and the Adviser seek to reduce these
                  operational risks through controls and procedures, there is no
                  way to completely protect against such risks.</font

                  ><b>Passive Investment Risk</b>. The Fund is not actively
                  managed and does not attempt to outperform its Index or take
                  defensive positions in declining markets. As a result, the
                  Fund�s performance may be adversely affected by a general
                  decline in the market segments relating to its Index. The
                  returns from the types of securities in which the Fund invests
                  may underperform returns from other securities markets or
                  different asset classes. This may cause the Fund to
                  underperform other investment vehicles that invest in
                  different asset classes. Different types of securities (for
                  example, fixed-income securities) tend to go through cycles of
                  doing better � or worse � than the general securities markets.
                  In the past, these periods have lasted for as long as several
                  years.</font

                          >The products of semiconductor companies may face
                          obsolescence due to rapid technological developments

                          changes in growth rates and competition for the
                          services of qualified personnel. Capital equipment
                          expenditures could be substantial, and equipment
                          generally suffers from rapid obsolescence. Companies
                          in the semiconductor industry are heavily dependent on
                          patent and intellectual property rights. The loss or
                          impairment of these rights would adversely affect the
                          profitability of these companies.</font

                  >The Fund imposes no restrictions on the frequency of

                  risks of market timing activities by Fund shareholders.
                  Purchases and redemptions by APs, who are the only parties
                  that may purchase or redeem Shares directly with the Fund, are
                  an essential part of the ETF process and help keep Share
                  trading prices in line with the NAV. As such, the Fund
                  accommodates frequent purchases and redemptions by APs.
                  However, the Board has also determined that frequent purchases
                  and redemptions for cash may increase tracking error and
                  portfolio transaction costs and may lead to the realization of
                  capital gains. To minimize these potential consequences of
                  frequent purchases and redemptions, the Fund employs fair
                  value pricing and may impose transaction fees on purchases and
                  redemptions of Creation Units to cover the custodial and other
                  costs incurred by the Fund in effecting trades. In addition,
                  the Fund and the Adviser reserve the right to reject any

                  >The Board has designated the Adviser as the �valuation
                  designee� for the Fund under Rule 2a-5 of the 1940 Act,
                  subject to its oversight. The Adviser has adopted procedures
                  and methodologies, which have been approved by the Board, to
                  fair value Fund investments whose market prices are not
                  �readily available� or are deemed to be unreliable. For
                  example, such circumstances may arise when: (i) an investment
                  has been delisted or has had its trading halted or suspended;
                  (ii) an investment�s primary pricing source is unable or
                  unwilling to provide a price; (iii) an investment�s primary
                  trading market is closed during regular market hours; or (iv)
                  an investment�s value is materially affected by events
                  occurring after the close of the investment�s primary trading
                  market. Generally, when fair valuing an investment, the
                  Adviser will take into account all reasonably available
                  information that may be relevant to a particular valuation
                  including, but not limited to, fundamental analytical data
                  regarding the issuer, information relating to the issuer�s
                  business, recent trades or offers of the investment, general
                  and/or specific market conditions, and the specific facts
                  giving rise to the need to fair value the investment. Fair
                  value determinations are made in good faith and in accordance
                  with the fair value methodologies included in the
                  Adviser-adopted valuation procedures. Due to the subjective
                  and variable nature of fair value pricing, there can be no
                  assurance that the Adviser will be able to obtain the fair
                  value assigned to the investment upon the sale of such
                  investment.</font

                  >For federal income tax purposes, distributions of net
                  investment income are generally taxable to shareholders as
                  ordinary income or qualified dividend income. Taxes on
                  distributions of net capital gains (if any) are determined by
                  how long the Fund owned the investments that generated them,
                  rather than how long a shareholder has owned their Shares.
                  Sales of assets held by the Fund for more than one year
                  generally result in long-term capital gains and losses, and
                  sales of assets held by the Fund for one year or less
                  generally result in short-term capital gains and losses.
                  Distributions of the Fund�s net capital gain (the excess of
                  net long-term capital gains over net short-term capital
                  losses) that are reported by the Fund as capital gain
                  dividends (�Capital Gain Dividends�) will be taxable as
                  long-term capital gains to shareholders. Distributions of
                  short-term capital gain will generally be taxable to
                  shareholders as ordinary income. Dividends and distributions
                  are generally taxable to you whether you receive them in cash
                  or reinvest them in additional Shares.</font

                  income if that stock is readily tradable on an established
                  U.S. securities market. Corporate shareholders may be entitled

                  Fund may be required to withhold a generally nonrefundable 30%
                  tax on distributions of net investment income paid to (A)
                  certain �foreign financial institutions� unless such foreign
                  financial institution agrees to verify, monitor, and report to
                  the Internal Revenue Service (�IRS�) the identity of certain
                  of its account-holders, among other items (or unless such
                  entity is otherwise deemed compliant under the terms of an
                  intergovernmental agreement between the United States and the
                  foreign financial institution�s country of residence), and (B)
                  certain �non-financial foreign entities� unless such entity

                  identification number of each substantial U.S. owner, among
                  other items. This FATCA withholding tax could also affect the
                  Fund�s return on its investments in foreign securities or
                  affect a shareholder�s return if the shareholder holds its
                  Fund shares through a foreign intermediary. You are urged to
                  consult your tax adviser regarding the application of this
                  FATCA withholding tax to your investment in the Fund and the
                  potential certification, compliance, due diligence, reporting,
                  and withholding obligations to which you may become subject in
                  order to avoid this withholding tax.</font

                  >The Third Amended and Restated Agreement and Declaration of
                  Trust (�Declaration of Trust�) provides a detailed process for
                  the bringing of derivative or direct actions by shareholders
                  in order to permit legitimate inquiries and claims while
                  avoiding the time, expense, distraction, and other harm that
                  can be caused to the Fund or its shareholders as a result of
                  spurious shareholder demands and derivative actions. Prior to
                  bringing a derivative action, a demand by three unrelated
                  shareholders must first be made on the Fund�s Trustees. The
                  Declaration of Trust details various information,
                  certifications, undertakings and acknowledgments that must be
                  included in the demand. Following receipt of the demand, the
                  trustees have a period of 90 days, which may be extended by an
                  additional 60 days, to consider the demand. If a majority of
                  the Trustees who are considered independent for the purposes
                  of considering the demand determine that maintaining the suit
                  would not be in the best interests of the Fund, the Trustees
                  are required to reject the demand and the complaining
                  shareholders may not proceed with the derivative action unless
                  the shareholders are able to sustain the burden of proof to a
                  court that the decision of the Trustees not to pursue the
                  requested action was not a good faith exercise of their
                  business judgment on behalf of the Fund. The Declaration of
                  Trust further provides that shareholders owning Shares
                  representing no less than a majority of the Fund�s outstanding
                  shares must join in bringing the derivative action. If a
                  demand is rejected, the complaining shareholders will be
                  responsible for the costs and expenses (including attorneys�
                  fees) incurred by the Fund in connection with the
                  consideration of the demand, if a court determines that the
                  demand was made without reasonable cause or for an improper
                  purpose. If a derivative action is brought in violation of the
                  Declaration of Trust, the shareholders bringing the action may
                  be responsible for the Fund�s costs, including attorneys�
                  fees, if a court determines that the action was brought
                  without reasonable cause or for an improper purpose. The
                  Declaration of Trust provides that no shareholder may bring a
                  direct action claiming injury as a shareholder of the Trust,
                  or any Fund, where the matters alleged (if true) would give
                  rise to a claim by the Trust or by the Trust on behalf of the
                  Fund, unless the shareholder has suffered an injury distinct
                  from that suffered by the shareholders of the Trust, or the
                  Fund, generally. Under the Declaration of Trust, a shareholder
                  bringing a direct claim must be a shareholder of the Fund with
                  respect to which the direct action is brought at the time of
                  the injury complained of or have acquired the shares
                  afterwards by operation of law from a person who was a
                  shareholder at that time. The Declaration of Trust further
                  provides that the Fund shall be responsible for payment of
                  attorneys� fees and legal expenses incurred by a complaining
                  shareholder only if required by law, and any attorneys� fees
                  that the Fund is obligated to pay shall be calculated using
                  reasonable hourly rates. These provisions do not apply to
                  claims brought under the federal securities laws.</font

                  >The Declaration of Trust also requires that actions by
                  shareholders against the Fund be brought exclusively in a
                  federal or state court located within the State of Delaware.
                  This provision will not apply to claims brought under the
                  federal securities laws. Limiting shareholders� ability to
                  bring actions only in courts located in Delaware may cause
                  shareholders economic hardship to litigate the action in those
                  courts, including paying for travel expenses of witnesses and
                  counsel, requiring retaining local counsel, and may limit
                  shareholders� ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum
                  that shareholders find favorable for disputes, which may
                  discourage such actions.</font

                  >The Fund is classified as a non-diversified investment
                  company under the 1940 Act�s diversification requirements. A
                  �non-diversified� classification means that the Fund is not
                  limited by the 1940 Act with regard to the percentage of its
                  assets that may be invested in the securities of a single
                  issuer. This means that the Fund may invest a greater portion
                  of its assets in the securities of a single issuer or a small
                  number of issuers than if it was a diversified fund, and
                  therefore, those issuers may constitute a greater portion of
                  the Fund�s portfolio. This may have an adverse effect on the
                  Fund�s performance or subject its Shares to greater price
                  volatility than more diversified investment companies.
                  Moreover, in pursuing its objective, the Fund may hold the
                  securities of a single issuer in an amount exceeding 10% of
                  the value of the outstanding securities of the issuer, subject
                  to restrictions imposed by the Internal Revenue Code of 1986,

                  qualify as a regulated investment company (�RIC�) for purposes
                  of the Code, and to relieve the Fund of any liability for
                  federal income tax to the extent that their earnings are
                  distributed to shareholders. Compliance with the
                  diversification requirements of the Code may limit the
                  investment flexibility of the Fund and may make it less likely

                  Fund, and their service providers may be subject to
                  operational and information security risks resulting from
                  cyber attacks. Cyber attacks include, among other behaviors,
                  stealing or corrupting data maintained online or digitally,
                  denial of service attacks on websites, the unauthorized
                  release of confidential information or various other forms of
                  cyber security breaches. Cyber attacks affecting the Fund or
                  the Adviser, Custodian (defined below), Transfer Agent
                  (defined below), intermediaries or other third-party service
                  providers may adversely impact the Fund. For instance, cyber
                  attacks may interfere with the processing of shareholder
                  transactions, impact the Fund�s ability to calculate its NAV,
                  cause the release of private shareholder information or
                  confidential company information, impede trading, subject the
                  Fund to regulatory fines or financial losses, and cause
                  reputational damage. The Fund may also incur additional costs
                  for cyber security risk management purposes. Similar types of
                  cyber security risks are also present for issuers of
                  securities in which the Fund invests, which could result in
                  material adverse consequences for such issuers, and may cause
                  the Fund�s investment in such portfolio companies to lose

                  adverse effect on the Fund�s ability to adjust its exposure to
                  the required levels in order to track the Index. Unusual
                  market conditions may cause the Index provider to postpone a
                  scheduled rebalance, which could cause the Index to vary from
                  its normal or expected composition. There is no assurance that
                  the Index provider or any agents that may act on its behalf
                  will compile the Index accurately, or that the Index will be
                  determined, composed or calculated accurately. Errors in
                  respect of the quality, accuracy and completeness of the data
                  used to compile the Index may occur from time to time and may
                  not be identified and corrected by the Index provider,
                  particularly where the indices are less commonly used as
                  benchmarks by funds or managers. Therefore, gains, losses or
                  costs associated with errors of the Index provider or its
                  agents will generally be borne by the Fund and its
                  shareholders. For example, during a period where the Index
                  contains incorrect constituents, the Fund would have market
                  exposure to such constituents and would be underexposed to the
                  Index�s other constituents. Such errors may negatively or

                  market exposure arising from such portfolio rebalancing will
                  be borne directly by the Fund and its shareholders. The Fund
                  may not be fully invested at times either as a result of cash
                  flows into the Fund or reserves of cash held by the Fund to
                  pay expenses or to meet redemptions. In addition, the Fund may
                  not invest in certain securities and/or other assets included
                  in the Index, or invest in them in the exact proportions in
                  which they are represented in the Index. The Fund�s
                  performance may also deviate from the return of the Index for
                  a variety of reasons, including certain exchange listing
                  standards (where applicable), a lack of liquidity in markets
                  in which such securities trade, potential adverse tax
                  consequences or other regulatory reasons (such as
                  diversification requirements). A lack of liquidity may be due
                  to various events, including market events, economic
                  conditions or investor perceptions. Illiquid securities may be
                  difficult to value and their value may be lower than the
                  market price of comparable liquid securities, which would
                  negatively affect the Fund�s performance. Moreover, the Fund
                  may be delayed in purchasing or selling securities included in
                  the Index. When markets are volatile, the ability to sell
                  securities at fair value prices may be adversely impacted and
                  may result in additional trading costs and/or increase the
                  index tracking risk. The Fund may also need to rely on
                  borrowings to meet redemptions, which may lead to increased
                  expenses. For tax efficiency purposes, the Fund may sell
                  certain securities, and such sale may cause the Fund to
                  realize a loss and deviate from the performance of the Index.
                  The Fund�s performance may also deviate from the performance
                  of the Index due to the impact of withholding taxes, late
                  announcements relating to changes to the Index and high

                  1940 Act, the Fund may borrow up to one-third (1/3) of its
                  total assets. The Fund will borrow money only for short-term

                  the stock market may deteriorate (either of which may cause a
                  decrease in the value of the Fund�s portfolio securities and
                  therefore a decrease in the value of Shares of the Fund).
                  Common stocks are susceptible to general stock market
                  fluctuations and to volatile increases and decreases in value
                  as market confidence and perceptions change. These investor
                  perceptions are based on various and unpredictable factors,
                  including expectations regarding government, economic,
                  monetary and fiscal policies; inflation and interest rates;
                  economic expansion or contraction; and global or regional

                  typically have a stated principal amount payable at maturity
                  (whose value, however, is subject to market fluctuations prior
                  thereto), or preferred stocks, which typically have a

                  ><i>Rights and Warrants</i> � A right is a privilege granted
                  to existing shareholders of a corporation to subscribe to
                  shares of a new issue of common stock before it is issued.
                  Rights normally have a short life of usually two to four
                  weeks, are freely transferable and entitle the holder to buy
                  the new common stock at a lower price than the public offering
                  price. Warrants are securities that are usually issued
                  together with a debt security or preferred stock and that give
                  the holder the right to buy a proportionate amount of common
                  stock at a specified price. Warrants are freely transferable
                  and are traded on major exchanges. Unlike rights, warrants
                  normally have a life that is measured in years and entitles
                  the holder to buy common stock of a company at a price that is
                  usually higher than the market price at the time the warrant
                  is issued. Corporations often issue warrants to make the
                  accompanying debt security more attractive.</font

                  >An investment in warrants and rights may entail greater risks
                  than certain other types of investments. Generally, rights and
                  warrants do not carry the right to receive dividends or
                  exercise voting rights with respect to the underlying
                  securities, and they do not represent any rights in the assets
                  of the issuer. In addition, their value does not necessarily
                  change with the value of the underlying securities, and they
                  cease to have value if they are not exercised on or before
                  their expiration date. Investing in rights and warrants
                  increases the potential profit or loss to be realized from the
                  investment as compared with investing the same amount in the

                  is one whose terms are available and for which a market

                  in when-issued transactions, it relies on the other party to
                  complete the sale. If the other party fails to complete the

                  >The Fund may invest directly in foreign securities or have
                  indirect exposure to foreign securities. Investing in
                  securities of foreign companies and countries involves certain
                  considerations and risks that are not typically associated
                  with investing in U.S. government securities and securities of
                  domestic companies. There may be less publicly available
                  information about a foreign issuer than a domestic one, and
                  foreign companies are not generally subject to uniform
                  accounting, auditing and financial standards, and requirements
                  comparable to those applicable to U.S. companies. There may
                  also be less government supervision and regulation of foreign
                  securities exchanges, brokers, and listed companies than
                  exists in the United States. Interest and dividends paid by
                  foreign issuers as well as gains or proceeds realized from the
                  sale or other disposition of foreign securities may be subject
                  to withholding and other foreign taxes, which may decrease the
                  net return on such investments as compared to dividends and
                  interest paid to the Fund by domestic companies or the U.S.
                  government. There may be the possibility of expropriations,
                  seizure or nationalization of foreign deposits, the imposition
                  of economic sanctions, confiscatory taxation, political,
                  economic or social instability, or diplomatic developments
                  that could affect assets of the Fund held in foreign
                  countries. The establishment of exchange controls or other
                  foreign governmental laws or restrictions could adversely
                  affect the payment of obligations. In addition, investing in
                  foreign securities will generally result in higher commissions
                  than investing in similar domestic securities.</font

                  >Investing in emerging markets can have more risk than
                  investing in developed foreign markets. The risks of investing
                  in these markets may be exacerbated relative to investments in
                  foreign markets. Governments of developing and emerging market
                  countries may be more unstable as compared to more developed
                  countries. Developing and emerging market countries may have
                  less developed securities markets or exchanges, and legal and
                  accounting systems. It may be more difficult to sell
                  securities at acceptable prices and security prices may be
                  more volatile than in countries with more mature markets.
                  Currency values may fluctuate more in developing or emerging
                  markets. Developing or emerging market countries may be more
                  likely to impose government restrictions, including
                  confiscatory taxation, expropriation or nationalization of a
                  company�s assets, and restrictions on foreign ownership of
                  local companies. In addition, emerging markets may impose
                  restrictions on the Fund�s ability to repatriate investment
                  income or capital and, thus, may adversely affect the
                  operations of the Fund. Certain emerging markets may impose
                  constraints on currency exchange and some currencies in
                  emerging markets may have been devalued significantly against

                  >Illiquid investments are often restricted securities sold in

                  purchasers and may be neither listed on an exchange nor traded
                  in other established markets. In many cases, the privately
                  placed securities may not be freely transferable under the
                  laws of the applicable jurisdiction or due to contractual
                  restrictions on resale. To the extent privately placed
                  securities may be resold in privately negotiated transactions,
                  the prices realized from the sales could be less than those
                  originally paid by the Fund or less than the fair value of the
                  securities. In addition, issuers whose securities are not
                  publicly traded may not be subject to the disclosure and other
                  investor protection requirements that may be applicable if
                  their securities were publicly traded. If any privately placed
                  securities held by the Fund are required to be registered
                  under the securities laws of one or more jurisdictions before
                  being resold, the Fund may be required to bear the expenses of
                  registration. Private placement investments may involve
                  investments in smaller, less seasoned issuers, which may
                  involve greater risks than investments in more established
                  companies. These issuers may have limited product lines,
                  markets or financial resources, or they may be dependent on a
                  limited management group. In making investments in private
                  placement securities, the Fund may obtain access to material
                  non-public information, which may restrict the Fund�s ability

                  instruments may be purchased on a current or a forward-settled
                  basis. Money market instruments also include shares of money
                  market funds. Time deposits are non-negotiable deposits
                  maintained in banking institutions for specified periods of
                  time at stated interest rates. Bankers� acceptances are time

                  ><b>Board Responsibilities.</b> The Board oversees the
                  management and operations of the Trust. Like all mutual funds,
                  the day-to-day management and operation of the Trust is the
                  responsibility of the various service providers to the Trust,
                  such as the Adviser, the Distributor, the Administrator, the
                  Sub-Administrator, the Custodian, and the Transfer Agent, each
                  of whom is discussed in greater detail in this Statement of
                  Additional Information. The Board has appointed various senior
                  employees of the Administrator as officers of the Trust, with
                  responsibility to monitor and report to the Board on the
                  Trust�s operations. In conducting this oversight, the Board
                  receives regular reports from these officers and the service
                  providers. For example, the Treasurer reports as to financial
                  reporting matters and the President reports as to matters
                  relating to the Trust�s operations. In addition, the Adviser
                  provides regular reports on the investment strategy and
                  performance of the Fund. The Board has appointed a Chief
                  Compliance Officer who administers the Trust�s compliance
                  program and regularly reports to the Board as to compliance
                  matters. These reports are provided as part of formal �Board
                  Meetings� which are typically held quarterly, in person, and
                  involve the Board�s review of recent operations. In addition,
                  various members of the Board also meet with management in less
                  formal settings, between formal �Board Meetings,� to discuss
                  various topics. In all cases, however, the role of the Board
                  and of any individual Trustee is one of oversight and not of
                  management of the day-to-day affairs of the Trust and its
                  oversight role does not make the Board a guarantor of the
                  Trust�s investments, operations or activities.</font

                  reviews various risk management reports and discusses these
                  matters with appropriate management and other personnel.
                  Because risk management is a broad concept comprised of many
                  elements (e.g., investment risk, issuer and counterparty risk,
                  compliance risk, operational risks, business continuity risks,
                  etc.), the oversight of different types of risks is handled in
                  different ways. For example, the Board meets regularly with
                  the CCO to discuss compliance and operational risks and the
                  Audit Committee meets with the Trust�s independent public
                  accounting firm to discuss, among other things, the internal
                  control structure of the Trust�s financial reporting

                  >The Board recognizes that not all risks that may affect the
                  Fund can be identified and/or quantified, that it may not be
                  practical or cost-effective to eliminate or mitigate certain
                  risks, that it may be necessary to bear certain risks (such as
                  investment-related risks) to achieve the Fund�s goals, and
                  that the processes, procedures, and controls employed to
                  address certain risks may be limited in their effectiveness.
                  Moreover, reports received by the Board as to risk management
                  matters are typically summaries of the relevant information.
                  Most of the Fund�s investment management and business affairs
                  are carried out by or through the Adviser and other service
                  providers, each of which has an independent interest in risk
                  management but whose policies and the methods by which one or
                  more risk management functions are carried out may differ from
                  the Fund�s and each other�s in the setting of priorities, the
                  resources available, or the effectiveness of relevant
                  controls. As a result of the foregoing and other factors, the
                  Board�s ability to monitor and manage risk, as a practical
                  matter, is subject to limitations.</font

                  ><b>Description of Material Conflicts of Interest<i>. </i></b
                  >The portfolio managers� management of �other accounts� may
                  give rise to potential conflicts of interest in connection
                  with their management of the Fund�s investments, on the one
                  hand, and the investments of the other accounts, on the other.
                  The other accounts may have similar investment objectives or
                  strategies as the Fund. A potential conflict of interest may
                  arise as a result, whereby a portfolio manager could favor one
                  account over another. Another potential conflict could include
                  a portfolio manager�s knowledge about the size, timing, and
                  possible market impact of Fund trades, whereby a portfolio
                  manager could use this information to the advantage of other
                  accounts and to the disadvantage of the Fund. For instance,
                  the portfolio managers may receive fees from certain accounts
                  that are higher than the fees received from the Fund, or
                  receive a performance-based fee on certain accounts. In those
                  instances, a portfolio manager has an incentive to favor the
                  higher and/or performance-based fee accounts over the Fund. To
                  mitigate these conflicts, the Adviser has established policies
                  and procedures to ensure that the purchase and sale of
                  securities among all accounts the firm manages are fairly and
                  equitably allocated.</font

                  support (such as through conferences, webinars, and printed
                  communications). The Adviser will periodically assess the
                  advisability of continuing to make these payments. Payments to
                  an Intermediary may be significant to the Intermediary, and
                  amounts that Intermediaries pay to your adviser, broker, or
                  other investment professional, if any, may also be significant
                  to such adviser, broker, or investment professional. Because
                  an Intermediary may make decisions about what investment
                  options it will make available or recommend, and what services
                  to provide in connection with various products, based on
                  payments it receives or is eligible to receive, such payments
                  create conflicts of interest between the Intermediary and its
                  clients. For example, these financial incentives may cause the
                  Intermediary to recommend the Fund over other investments. The
                  same conflict of interest exists with respect to your
                  financial adviser, broker, or investment professional if they
                  receive similar payments from their Intermediary firm.</font

                  financial interest in the Plan or in any agreements related to

                  The Board has determined that the Plan is likely to benefit
                  the Fund by providing an incentive for brokers, dealers, and
                  other financial intermediaries to engage in sales and
                  marketing efforts on behalf of the Fund and to provide
                  enhanced services to shareholders. The Board also determined
                  that the Plan may enhance the Fund�s ability to sell shares
                  and access important distribution channels.</font

                  >The policy of the Trust regarding purchases and sales of
                  securities for the Fund is that primary consideration will be
                  given to obtaining the most favorable prices and efficient
                  executions of transactions. Consistent with this policy, when
                  securities transactions are effected on a stock exchange, the
                  Trust�s policy is to pay commissions which are considered fair
                  and reasonable without necessarily determining that the lowest
                  possible commissions are paid in all circumstances. The Trust
                  believes that a requirement always to seek the lowest possible
                  commission cost could impede effective portfolio management
                  and preclude the Fund and the Adviser from obtaining a high
                  quality of brokerage and research services. In seeking to
                  determine the reasonableness of brokerage commissions paid in
                  any transaction, the Adviser will rely upon their experience
                  and knowledge regarding commissions generally charged by
                  various brokers and on its judgment in evaluating the
                  brokerage services received from the broker effecting the
                  transaction. Such determinations are necessarily subjective
                  and imprecise, as in most cases, an exact dollar value for
                  those services is not ascertainable. The Trust has adopted
                  policies and procedures that prohibit the consideration of
                  sales of Shares as a factor in the selection of a broker or
                  dealer to execute its portfolio transactions.</font

                  price, commission, timing, aggregated trades, capable floor
                  brokers or traders, competent block trading coverage, ability

                  information on a particular security or market in which the
                  transaction is to occur. The specific criteria will vary
                  depending upon the nature of the transaction, the market in
                  which it is executed, and the extent to which it is possible
                  to select from among multiple broker/ dealers. The Adviser

                  determines the total commission (including the soft dollar

                  be expected to be received from other brokers. The amount of

                  otherwise be able to negotiate, (2) cause clients to engage in

                  >The Adviser faces a potential conflict of interest when it
                  uses client trades to obtain brokerage or research services.
                  This conflict exists because the Adviser can use the brokerage
                  or research services to manage client accounts without paying
                  cash for such services, which reduces the Adviser�s expenses
                  to the extent that the Adviser would have purchased such
                  products had they not been provided by brokers. Section 28(e)
                  permits the Adviser to use brokerage or research services for
                  the benefit of any account it manages. Certain accounts
                  managed by the Adviser may generate soft dollars used to
                  purchase brokerage or research services that ultimately
                  benefit other accounts managed by the Adviser effectively
                  cross subsidizing the other accounts managed by the Adviser
                  that benefit directly from the product. The Adviser may not
                  necessarily use all of the brokerage or research services in
                  connection with managing the Fund whose trades generated the
                  soft dollars used to purchase such products.</font

                  >A portfolio turnover rate is, in summary, the percentage
                  computed by dividing the lesser of the Fund�s purchases or
                  sales of securities (excluding short-term securities and
                  securities transferred in-kind) by the average market value of
                  the Fund. A rate of 100% indicates that the equivalent of all
                  of the Fund�s assets have been sold and reinvested in a year.
                  High portfolio turnover may affect the amount, timing and
                  character of distributions, and, as a result, may increase the
                  amount of taxes payable by shareholders. Higher portfolio
                  turnover also results in higher transaction costs. To the
                  extent that net short-term capital gains are realized by the
                  Fund, any distributions resulting from such gains are

                  >DTC is a limited-purpose trust company that was created to
                  hold securities of its participants (the �DTC Participants�)
                  and to facilitate the clearance and settlement of securities
                  transactions among the DTC Participants in such securities
                  through electronic book-entry changes in accounts of the DTC
                  Participants, thereby eliminating the need for physical
                  movement of securities certificates. DTC Participants include
                  securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies,
                  clearing corporations and certain other organizations, some of
                  whom (and/or their representatives) own DTC. More
                  specifically, DTC is owned by a number of its DTC Participants
                  and by the New York Stock Exchange (�NYSE�) and FINRA. Access
                  to the DTC system is also available to others such as banks,
                  brokers, dealers, and trust companies that clear through or
                  maintain a custodial relationship with a DTC Participant,
                  either directly or indirectly (the �Indirect

                  Owners will receive from or through the DTC Participant a

                  certificates. Each Beneficial Owner must rely on the
                  procedures of DTC and any DTC Participant and/or Indirect

                  interests, to exercise any rights of a holder of Shares.</font

                  delivered, as applicable, and the validity, form and
                  eligibility (including time of receipt) for the deposit of any
                  tendered securities or cash, as applicable, will be determined
                  by the Trust, whose determination shall be final and binding.

                  Trust of all or a portion of the applicable Deposit Securities
                  as described below. In these circumstances, the initial
                  deposit will have a value greater than the NAV of the Shares
                  on the date the order is placed in proper form since, in
                  addition to available Deposit Securities, cash must be
                  deposited in an amount equal to the sum of (i) the Cash
                  Component, plus (ii) an additional amount of cash equal to a
                  percentage of the value as set forth in the Participant
                  Agreement, of the undelivered Deposit Securities (the
                  �Additional Cash Deposit�), which shall be maintained in a
                  separate non-interest bearing collateral account. The
                  Authorized Participant must deposit with the Custodian the
                  Additional Cash Deposit, as applicable, by [4:00 p.m.] Eastern
                  Time for the Fund (or such other time as specified by the
                  Trust) on the contractual settlement date. If the Fund or its
                  agents do not receive the Additional Cash Deposit in the
                  appropriate amount, by such time, then the order may be deemed
                  rejected and the Authorized Participant shall be liable to the
                  Fund for losses, if any, resulting therefrom. An additional
                  amount of cash shall be required to be deposited with the
                  Trust, pending delivery of the missing Deposit Securities to
                  the extent necessary to maintain the Additional Cash Deposit
                  with the Trust in an amount at least equal to the applicable
                  percentage, as set forth in the Participant Agreement, of the
                  daily market value of the missing Deposit Securities. The
                  Participant Agreement will permit the Trust to buy the missing
                  Deposit Securities at any time. Authorized Participants will
                  be liable to the Trust for the costs incurred by the Trust in
                  connection with any such purchases. These costs will be deemed
                  to include the amount by which the actual purchase price of
                  the Deposit Securities exceeds the value of such Deposit
                  Securities on the day the purchase order was deemed received
                  by the Transfer Agent plus the brokerage and related
                  transaction costs associated with such purchases. The Trust
                  will return any unused portion of the Additional Cash Deposit
                  once all of the missing Deposit Securities have been properly
                  received by the Custodian or purchased by the Trust and
                  deposited into the Trust. In addition, a transaction fee, as
                  described below under �Creation Transaction Fee,� may be
                  charged. The delivery of Creation Units so created generally
                  will occur no later than the contractual settlement
                  date.</font

                  ><b>Risks of Purchasing Creation Units. </b>There are certain
                  legal risks unique to investors purchasing Creation Units
                  directly from the Fund. Because Shares may be issued on an
                  ongoing basis, a �distribution� of Shares could be occurring
                  at any time. Certain activities that a shareholder performs as
                  a dealer could, depending on the circumstances, result in the
                  shareholder being deemed a participant in the distribution in
                  a manner that could render the shareholder a statutory
                  underwriter and subject to the prospectus delivery and
                  liability provisions of the Securities Act. For example, a
                  shareholder could be deemed a statutory underwriter if it
                  purchases Creation Units from the Fund, breaks them down into
                  the constituent Shares, and sells those Shares directly to
                  customers, or if a shareholder chooses to couple the creation
                  of a supply of new Shares with an active selling effort
                  involving solicitation of secondary-market demand for Shares.
                  Whether a person is an underwriter depends upon all of the
                  facts and circumstances pertaining to that person�s
                  activities, and the examples mentioned here should not be
                  considered a complete description of all the activities that
                  could cause you to be deemed an underwriter.</font

                  of any pricing service, as approved by the Adviser from time
                  to time. A price obtained from a pricing service based on such
                  pricing service�s valuation matrix may be considered a market
                  valuation. Any assets or liabilities denominated in currencies
                  other than the U.S. dollar are converted into U.S. dollars at
                  the current market rates on the date of valuation as quoted by
                  one or more sources. For assets traded on an exchange, the
                  Fund may value investments using market valuations. A market
                  valuation generally means a valuation (1) obtained from an
                  exchange, a pricing service, or a major market maker (or
                  dealer), (2) based on a price quotation or other equivalent
                  indication of value supplied by an exchange, a pricing
                  service, or a major market maker (or dealer) or (3) based on
                  amortized cost. In the case of shares of other funds that are
                  not traded on an exchange, a market valuation means such

                  after December 31, 2017. Many of the changes applicable to

                  years before January 1, 2026. There were only minor changes

                  ><b>Taxation of the Fund.</b> The Fund will elect and intends
                  to qualify each year to be treated as a RIC under the Code. As
                  such, the Fund should not be subject to federal income taxes
                  on its net investment income and capital gains, if any, to the
                  extent that it timely distributes such income and capital
                  gains to its shareholders. Generally, to be taxed as a RIC,
                  the Fund must distribute in each taxable year at least 90% of
                  its �investment company taxable income� (before the deduction
                  for dividends paid) for the taxable year, which includes,
                  among other items, dividends, interest, net short-term capital
                  gain, and net foreign currency gain, less expenses, as well as
                  90% of its net tax-exempt interest income, if any (the
                  �Distribution Requirement�) and also must meet several
                  additional requirements. Among these requirements are the
                  following: (1) at least 90% of the Fund�s gross income each
                  taxable year must be derived from dividends, interest,
                  payments with respect to certain securities loans, gains from
                  the sale or other disposition of stock, securities, or foreign
                  currencies, or other income derived with respect to its
                  business of investing in such stock, securities, or foreign
                  currencies, and net income derived from interests in qualified
                  publicly traded partnerships (the �Qualifying Income
                  Requirement�); and (2) at the end of each quarter of the
                  Fund�s taxable year, the Fund�s assets must be diversified so
                  that (a) at least 50% of the value of the Fund�s total assets
                  is represented by cash and cash items, U.S. government
                  securities, securities of other RICs, and other securities,
                  with such other securities limited, in respect to any one
                  issuer, to an amount not greater in value than 5% of the value
                  of the Fund�s total assets and to not more than 10% of the
                  outstanding voting securities of such issuer, and (b) not more
                  than 25% of the value of its total assets is invested in the
                  securities (other than U.S. government securities or
                  securities of other RICs) of any one issuer, the securities
                  (other than securities of other RICs) of two or more issuers
                  which the Fund controls and which are engaged in the same,
                  similar, or related trades or businesses, or the securities of
                  one or more qualified publicly traded partnerships (the

                  Requirement or the Diversification Requirement in any taxable
                  year, the Fund may be eligible for relief provisions if the
                  failures are due to reasonable cause and not willful neglect
                  and if a penalty tax is paid with respect to each failure to
                  satisfy the applicable requirements. Additionally, relief is
                  provided for certain <i>de minimis </i>failures of the
                  Diversification Requirement where the Fund corrects the
                  failure within a specified period of time. To be eligible for

                  Diversification Requirement, the Fund may be required to

                  available to the Fund and it were to fail to qualify for
                  treatment as a RIC for a taxable year, all of its taxable
                  income would be subject to tax at regular corporate rates
                  without any deduction for distributions to shareholders, and
                  its distributions (including capital gains distributions)
                  generally would be taxable to the shareholders of the Fund as
                  ordinary income dividends, subject to the dividends received
                  deduction for corporate shareholders and the lower tax rates
                  on qualified dividend income received by noncorporate
                  shareholders, subject to certain limitations. To requalify for
                  treatment as a RIC in a subsequent taxable year, the Fund
                  would be required to satisfy the RIC qualification
                  requirements for that year and to distribute any earnings and
                  profits from any year in which the Fund failed to qualify for
                  tax treatment as a RIC. If the Fund failed to qualify as a RIC
                  for a period greater than two taxable years, it would
                  generally be required to pay a fund-level tax on certain net
                  built in gains recognized with respect to certain of its
                  assets upon disposition of such assets within five years of

                  treatment as a RIC if it determines such course of action to
                  be beneficial to shareholders. If the Fund determines that it
                  will not qualify as a RIC, the Fund will establish procedures
                  to reflect the anticipated tax liability in the Fund�s

                  >Capital losses in excess of capital gains (�net capital
                  losses�) are not permitted to be deducted against a RIC�s net
                  investment income. Instead, for U.S. federal income tax
                  purposes, potentially subject to certain limitations, the Fund
                  may carry a net capital loss from any taxable year forward
                  indefinitely to offset its capital gains, if any, in years
                  following the year of the loss. To the extent subsequent
                  capital gains are offset by such losses, they will not result
                  in U.S. federal income tax liability to the Fund and may not
                  be distributed as capital gains to its shareholders.
                  Generally, the Fund may not carry forward any losses other
                  than net capital losses. The carryover of capital losses may
                  be limited under the general loss limitation rules if the Fund
                  experiences an ownership change as defined in the Code.</font

                  A return of capital distribution will generally not be
                  taxable, but will reduce each shareholder�s cost basis in the

                  when the Shares on which the distribution was received are
                  sold. After a shareholder�s basis in the Shares has been
                  reduced to zero, distributions in excess of earnings and

                  ><b>Taxation of Shareholders � Sale of Shares.</b> A sale or
                  redemption of Shares may give rise to a gain or loss. In
                  general, any gain or loss realized upon a taxable disposition
                  of Shares will be treated as long-term capital gain or loss if
                  Shares have been held for more than 12 months. Otherwise, the
                  gain or loss on the taxable disposition of Shares will
                  generally be treated as short-term capital gain or loss. Any
                  loss realized upon a taxable disposition of Shares held for
                  six months or less will be treated as long-term capital loss,
                  rather than short-term capital loss, to the extent of any
                  amounts treated as distributions to the shareholder of
                  long-term capital gain with respect to such Shares (including
                  any amounts credited to the shareholder as undistributed
                  capital gains). All or a portion of any loss realized upon a
                  taxable disposition of Shares may be disallowed if
                  substantially identical Shares are acquired (through the
                  reinvestment of dividends or otherwise) within a 61-day period
                  beginning 30 days before and ending 30 days after the
                  disposition. In such a case, the basis of the newly acquired
                  Shares will be adjusted to reflect the disallowed loss.</font

                  ><b>Taxation of Fund Investments.</b> Certain of the Fund�s
                  investments may be subject to complex provisions of the Code
                  (including provisions relating to hedging transactions,
                  straddles, integrated transactions, foreign currency
                  contracts, forward foreign currency contracts, and notional
                  principal contracts) that, among other things, may affect the
                  Fund�s ability to qualify as a RIC, affect the character of
                  gains and losses realized by the Fund (<i>e.g.</i>, may affect
                  whether gains or losses are ordinary or capital), accelerate
                  recognition of income to the Fund and defer losses. These
                  rules could therefore affect the character, amount and timing
                  of distributions to shareholders. These provisions also may
                  require the Fund to mark to market certain types of positions
                  in its portfolio (<i>i.e</i>., treat them as if they were
                  closed out) which may cause the Fund to recognize income
                  without the Fund receiving cash with which to make
                  distributions in amounts sufficient to enable the Fund to
                  satisfy the RIC distribution requirements for avoiding
                  Fund-level income and excise taxes. The Fund intends to
                  monitor its transactions, intends to make appropriate tax
                  elections, and intends to make appropriate entries in its
                  books and records to mitigate the effect of these rules and
                  preserve the Fund�s qualification for treatment as a RIC. To
                  the extent the Fund invests in an underlying fund that is
                  taxable as a RIC, the rules applicable to the tax treatment of
                  complex securities will also apply to the underlying funds
                  that also invest in such complex securities and investments.
                  In addition, because the tax rules applicable to such
                  instruments may be uncertain under current law, an adverse
                  determination or future IRS guidance with respect to these
                  rules (which determination or guidance could be retroactive)
                  may affect whether the Fund has made sufficient distributions
                  and otherwise satisfied the relevant requirements to maintain
                  its qualification as a RIC and avoid a Fund-level tax.</font

                  ><b>Backup Withholding.</b> The Fund will be required in
                  certain cases to withhold (as �backup withholding�) on amounts
                  payable to any shareholder who (1) fails to provide a correct
                  taxpayer identification number certified under penalty of
                  perjury; (2) is subject to backup withholding by the IRS for
                  failure to properly report all payments of interest or
                  dividends; (3) fails to provide a certified statement that
                  they are not subject to �backup withholding;� or (4) fails to
                  provide a certified statement that they are a U.S. person
                  (including a U.S. resident alien). The backup withholding rate
                  is at a rate set under Section 3406 of the Code. Backup
                  withholding is not an additional tax and any amounts withheld
                  may be credited against the shareholder�s ultimate U.S.
                  federal income tax liability. Backup withholding will not be
                  applied to payments that have been subject to the 30%
                  withholding tax on shareholders who are neither citizens nor
                  permanent residents of the United States.</font

                  ><b>Non-U.S. Shareholders.</b> Any non-U.S. investors in the
                  Fund may be subject to U.S. withholding and estate tax and are
                  encouraged to consult their tax advisors prior to investing in
                  the Fund. Foreign shareholders (<i>i.e.</i>, nonresident alien
                  individuals and foreign corporations, partnerships, trusts and
                  estates) are generally subject to a U.S. withholding tax at
                  the rate of 30% (or a lower tax treaty rate) on distributions
                  derived from taxable ordinary income. The Fund may, under
                  certain circumstances, report all or a portion of a dividend
                  as an �interest-related dividend� or a �short-term capital
                  gain dividend,� which would generally be exempt from this 30%
                  U.S. withholding tax, provided certain other requirements are
                  met. Short-term capital gain dividends received by a
                  nonresident alien individual who is present in the U.S. for a
                  period or periods aggregating 183 days or more during the
                  taxable year are not exempt from this 30% withholding tax.
                  Gains realized by foreign shareholders from the sale or other
                  disposition of Shares generally are not subject to U.S.
                  taxation, unless the recipient is an individual who is
                  physically present in the U.S. for 183 days or more per year
                  (based on a formula that factors in presence in the U.S.
                  during the two preceding years as well). Foreign shareholders
                  who fail to provide an applicable IRS form may be subject to
                  backup withholding on certain payments from the Fund. Backup
                  withholding will not be applied to payments that are subject
                  to the 30% (or lower applicable treaty rate) withholding tax
                  described in this paragraph. Different tax consequences may
                  result if the foreign shareholder is engaged in a trade or
                  business within the United States. In addition, the tax
                  consequences to a foreign shareholder entitled to claim the
                  benefits of a tax treaty may be different than those described
                  above.</font

                  ><b>Tax-Exempt Shareholders. </b>Certain tax-exempt
                  shareholders, including qualified pension plans, individual
                  retirement accounts, salary deferral arrangements, 401(k)
                  plans, and other tax-exempt entities, generally are exempt
                  from federal income taxation, except with respect to their
                  unrelated business taxable income (�UBTI�). Tax-exempt
                  entities are generally not permitted to offset losses from one
                  unrelated trade or business against the income or gain of
                  another unrelated trade or business. Certain net losses
                  incurred prior to January 1, 2018 are permitted to offset gain
                  and income created by an unrelated trade or business, if
                  otherwise available. Under current law, the Fund generally
                  serves to block UBTI from being realized by its tax-exempt
                  shareholders with respect to their shares of Fund income.
                  However, notwithstanding the foregoing, tax-exempt
                  shareholders could realize UBTI by virtue of their investment
                  in the Fund if, for example, (1) the Fund invests in residual
                  interests of Real Estate Mortgage Investment Conduits
                  (�REMICs�), (2) the Fund invests in a REIT that is a taxable
                  mortgage pool (�TMP�) or that has a subsidiary that is a TMP
                  or that invests in the residual interest of a REMIC, or (3)
                  Shares in the Fund constitute debt-financed property in the
                  hands of the tax-exempt shareholders within the meaning of
                  section 514(b) of the Code. Charitable remainder trusts are
                  subject to special rules and should consult their tax
                  advisers. The IRS has issued guidance with respect to these
                  issues and prospective shareholders, especially charitable
                  remainder trusts, are strongly encouraged to consult with
                  their tax advisers regarding these issues.</font

                  ><b>Certain Potential Tax Reporting Requirements. </b>Under
                  U.S. Treasury regulations, if a shareholder recognizes a loss
                  on disposition of the Shares of $2 million or more for an
                  individual shareholder or $10 million or more for a corporate
                  shareholder (or certain greater amounts over a combination of
                  years), the shareholder must file with the IRS a disclosure
                  statement on IRS Form 8886. Direct shareholders of portfolio
                  securities are in many cases excepted from this reporting
                  requirement, but under current guidance, shareholders of a RIC
                  are not excepted. Significant penalties may be imposed for the
                  failure to comply with the reporting requirements. The fact
                  that a loss is reportable under these regulations does not
                  affect the legal determination of whether the taxpayer�s
                  treatment of the loss is proper. Shareholders should consult
                  their tax advisors to determine the applicability of these
                  regulations in light of their individual circumstances.</font

                  amended (the Securities Act), the Registrant furnishes the
                  following undertaking: Insofar as indemnification for
                  liability arising under the Securities Act of 1933 may be
                  permitted to trustees, officers and controlling persons of the

                  Securities and Exchange Commission such indemnification is
                  against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and
                  is, therefore, unenforceable. In the event that a claim for
                  indemnification against such liabilities (other than the
                  payment by the Registrant of expenses incurred or paid by a
                  trustee, officer or controlling person of the Registrant in

                  asserted by such trustee, officer or controlling person in
                  connection with the securities being registered, the
                  Registrant will, unless in the opinion of its counsel the

                  court of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such
